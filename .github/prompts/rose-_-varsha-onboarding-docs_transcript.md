Rose Malcolm** started transcription

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 0:03  
Which is why I need to check in on on the create on behalf of stuff, because I remember that we talked about it, but I didn't write down what we talked about and so now I can't remember it. Anyway, let's begin with your things, the private preview docs and what changes we need to make to the.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 0:13  
Oh.  
Oh.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 0:19  
Documentation for Hosteen.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 0:22  
Yep. So the first thing I wanted to bring up is that I've started a draft for the private preview documentation. I decided to put it in a GitHub repository since I think this is what they did for.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 0:30  
Mhm.  
Yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 0:40  
Um, customizations. I think you were the one who suggested this to me. Um.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 0:43  
Yeah, no, that's totally the best way to go.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 0:47  
So I've written a draft. My if I get to it by the end of this week, my goal is to start creating like a test tenant from scratch and just doing the whole thing from scratch. I I've made the tenant but I'm having some issues.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 0:52  
Mm-hmm.  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 1:04  
Logging into the tenant. I don't know if you've made a test tenant in the past on Bammy Rose.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 1:10  
Yes, I have. I I'm working with a BAMI client right now, so I don't know.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 1:18  
I.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 1:18  
Do you do you want to show me what the issues are or do you want to?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 1:20  
I created. Yeah, sure. One second. Let me. Let me share with you.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 1:29  
Because I find with BAMI it can be really difficult to tell it which client you want to log into and it it gives you that kind of blue screen of Nope, that's not it.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 1:37  
E.  
Yes, so I created my tenant. OK, I I named it Iyer Varsha. Very original. There's the domain name. It's approved at this point, but.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 1:44  
Mhm.  
Mhm.  
Mhm, mm.  
Mhm.  
Right.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 1:58  
I went into my directories and let me just control F5 to make sure it hard refreshed, but I don't see it in my list of directories like I'd assumed there would be like an Iyer Varsha.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 2:09  
I don't see it.  
Yeah, no, I know what you mean.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 2:19  
And I didn't know if I needed to make my own account.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 2:24  
Yeah, OK. Do you have any documentation for this that you were following?  
Or did you just follow a link? Hang on a minute.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 2:33  
I was watch. I was watching a video, yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 2:38  
Oh, hang on, I have something you will find useful.  
I'm going to send you a link. This is what we have in the contributor's guide for setting up an Azure subscription with a new BAMI tenant. Now I have to ask as well, when you did this request, which type of tenant did you request or which type of BAMI subscription I should say?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 3:05  
I think I did test. No, I didn't do enterprise.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 3:10  
Yeah, no, that's fine. Hang on, sorry.  
Confused.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 3:22  
Account type SMB.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 3:26  
Yeah. So you did the standard test account and then you did the one that isn't enterprise, right?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 3:32  
Yep, I definitely picked. I remember the video explicitly. It was Trent going through the entity and he said explicitly to not pick an enterprise because for some reason that's more complicated.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 3:33  
Yeah, I am.  
Mhm.  
Oh, bless.  
Yeah, yeah, totally. OK, so I have dropped in the chat a document. This is from the contributors guide again, top right to sign in or or you know you can try signing in.  
Um.  
Alright.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 4:07  
Your tenants. So now maybe this is what I need to do. I need to create the accounts.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 4:11  
Yeah, from this.  
And.  
New global administrator account and then you will.  
I mean, I'm assuming it's.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 4:23  
How do you know? How do you know your alias?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 4:25  
Go on.  
Um, it's just your alias. The no, it's just the front bit of your Microsoft account.  
Go back to the dock and read more slowly.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 4:37  
Oh.  
So I need to do I need to do Varsha Iyer at Iyer Varsha on microsoft.com.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 4:41  
Yeah.  
No, go back and read the document more slowly. Honestly, it does say right. So your Microsoft account is global admin for your newly created tenant, right?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 5:01  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 5:02  
Did you get one of these emails that says get your tenant this?  
Uh.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 5:08  
No, I don't think so.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 5:11  
Wait a sec.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 5:12  
Ami.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 5:20  
Um, where is it now?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 5:22  
Yeah, I didn't get an e-mail.  
Get new tenants.  
No.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 5:34  
OK.  
Get started with billing account.  
Oh man. OK, so I have two emails. I think one of them is.  
Can I share my screen for a SEC?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 5:56  
Yes, Yep.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 6:02  
Oh, I can't. I can't remember anything.  
OK, screen share, right? So I got this one. It says your request for billing account has been reproved, right?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 6:22  
Oh.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 6:24  
Did you get this? And if you click.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 6:24  
Let me just look up your question.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 6:28  
I'm gonna have to, yeah, I'm needing to turn my VPN on, so.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 6:34  
I did. I did get that.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 6:36  
You got that one. OK, and if you click view request, it takes you to the BAMI portal basically and says hey, your request is all done.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 6:38  
I need to turn on Vivian too.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 6:49  
press details, blah, blah, blah. Okay.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 6:50  
I miss.  
And I think that's when I got to. That's how I found the request, I'm assuming.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 6:56  
Yeah, yeah. Do you have this thing at the bottom? Log in information where it takes you to log into your tenant?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 7:06  
Oh, let me check for that. I'm that would be ridiculous if I didn't.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 7:09  
Mhm.  
Honestly, I missed it the first time, so.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 7:17  
But approval information.  
Where's login information?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 7:24  
Yeah, I didn't see it when you were sharing your screen a moment ago, so I don't know if we have a slightly different tenant type or something.  
Let me show you what I did to get mine so.  
So this is the Bami portal, right? So if I go for a new request and then I do my darn it.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 7:43  
Mhm, mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 7:52  
I hate these things.  
Valu.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 7:57  
Yeah, I don't see login information.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 7:59  
Yeah.  
Um.  
Content Developer Sobs.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 8:12  
Manage my test accounts.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 8:21  
OK.  
Doesn't really matter.  
This is what you were talking about, wasn't it? Account type, standard organization, not enterprise. And when you read it through, yeah, it just says customer layer self-service and this one is just for the field folks.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 8:38  
Yes.  
Yep, I definitely didn't pick up the card.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 8:51  
It's really complex. Don't, don't do it. So if you selected standard, that's the same as I've got. And then in tenant provisioning, did you do you remember if you did create a new tenant or use an existing tenant?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 8:52  
Mm.  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 9:11  
And.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 9:13  
Pretty sure I did create a new tenant.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 9:14  
Yeah, because I think with the stuff that we have in that we need to have quite extensive licensing and products and stuff to configure. We need to have a new tenant. If we have just an existing tenant, you can't do a lot of the stuff like.  
You can't like create user accounts and things like that, which isn't going to work for what we're trying to do. So then you did create a new tenant, you did your customer org name, which is the IO Varsha or whatever, and that became your domain name and and blah blah blah and you would have gone.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 9:35  
Yeah.  
Mhm.  
Mhm, mhm, Yep.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 9:54  
Through from there. So it seems like you've gone through the same steps as me, but maybe it's not actually finished. When did you do the request?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 9:58  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 10:03  
West.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 10:04  
Yesterday morning.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 10:06  
Yeah, it sometimes takes a day or so for that second e-mail to come through.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 10:12  
Oh really? What is the second e-mail?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 10:13  
Yeah, sorry. Hang on, I'll.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 10:18  
Request for billing account has been approved. I got that.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 10:22  
You got the oh, your question's been approved and the next one. Sorry, I'm just looking for it in my emails because I ordered some stuff from the Microsoft Company store. Uh, here it is.  
It'll have the subject line. Um, set up of your billing account is complete.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 10:46  
OK.  
No, I don't have that one yet.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 10:52  
OK, so can you share your screen again? Let's go back to your request in the BAMI portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 11:05  
Here's the request.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 11:09  
OK.  
Status action required.  
Scroll down.  
You see where it says complete my request that button there in the bottom.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 11:26  
Oh, do I have to click on that?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 11:29  
You have to click on that.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 11:31  
Oh my God.  
Oh God, why? I did not know that was a step. Why do you have to do that?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 11:40  
Anywho.  
Um.  
I have no idea what you're doing anyway, so it might take a little time now, like depending how busy folks are, whether it's.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 11:52  
Oh God, wow.  
Thank you so much.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 12:06  
Yeah, and then you've got the click click here to login thing at the bottom there, right?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 12:12  
Wow. Yep. Yep, it's there.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 12:16  
But go back and and read that document to make sure you're logging in at the right time to the right people. Or go back to Trent and make sure you're doing it the way that you need to do it for your set up. I'll be really interesting to find out, interested to find out whether you get that same error that I'm getting.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 12:29  
yep okay

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 12:35  
Heading on my Bami subscription where it can't create a dev box definition and it can't create an image definition.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 12:37  
Uh.  
Yeah, 'cause you've been telling me about this for a while.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 12:46  
I am so frustrated. I just last week and the beginning of this week set up a new BAMI subscription for myself because they expire every three months for us. I don't know if it's the same for you, but so I've just been through that process.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 12:48  
Right?  
Mhm.  
Yeah, it is.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 13:02  
And like, I swear to God, I followed that document to the absolute T and it's still giving me that same error. And I don't know why it is. I emailed Joe.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 13:03  
Oh.  
Yeah.  
Oh God.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 13:17  
To ask him about it, but I only did it yesterday, so he hasn't replied yet.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 13:23  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 13:24  
But yeah, I mean, if you get that same error, at least we can then, you know, team up, take it to Trent or whatever and go or whoever on the dev team knows what's causing it. You know, what is it that the.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 13:25  
Oh God.  
Yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 13:40  
That Devbox is trying to do that's causing it to try to write A tag to the tenant and.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 13:40  
I'll let you know, yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 13:48  
How you know if if my account that I log in as is a global administrator, how does that not have permission to write to the tenant? In which case is it doing under the under the auspices of the dev center? In which case can I give permissions to the dev center?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 13:57  
Yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 14:06  
To have it. And are any of our clients and customers running into this? Because it's nuts. Do you know what I mean anyway?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 14:08  
Yeah.  
Yeah, yes, yeah. Let's see. I'm gonna be going through end to end set up because I need to do. I need to do the Harstein run through. So yeah, if I if I run into that, I'll let you know.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 14:25  
Yeah.  
Sure, sure. And um.  
Yeah, let me know how that goes, because obviously I'd be really interested to see that because I'm gonna need to document it at some point.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 14:39  
Huh. Yeah. Yep.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 14:40  
Which I guess brings us back round to the private preview documentation which you have put into a private repo which I had do have access to now so.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 14:50  
Yes.  
Cool. And yeah, I just wanted to put that on your radar cause I will probably ask you to look at the documentation, especially after I take a pass walking through the whole thing end to end so.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 15:06  
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 15:09  
That was one thing I wanted to bring up. The other aspect is that we have the November 1st deadline happening, which is where we officially shut down like billing like customers can't.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 15:10  
Mhm.  
Mm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 15:24  
On board onto the old on board onto the old model. Um.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 15:25  
Oh my gosh, you're right.  
But existing customers can still use it, right?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 15:31  
Yes, existing customers can still use it. I had a couple thoughts on what we might want to add to the docs, but want to I want to hear your thoughts on this as well.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 15:34  
OK.  
Mm.  
Go on.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 15:48  
There are going to be edge cases where we might have customers who.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 15:53  
Mm-hmm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 15:56  
No, they've been making POCS with Devbox and testing things out, but they don't have an official subscription.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 16:04  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 16:05  
And they might want to continue, you know, onboarding onto dev box post November 1st. So we might want to. We need to have some sort of a process to file an exception. So for example, I'm thinking right now of setting up an e-mail.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 16:14  
Right.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 16:25  
Alias and having folks e-mail that specific alias with where I can maybe automate like an automatic e-mail can be sent out saying hey you need to fill out these details, we need your tenant ID, we need your justification as to why you want you want to file an exception.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 16:26  
Mhm.  
Mhm.  
Mhm.  
Mhm, yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 16:46  
Um.  
And then they can give us those details and we we like send it out. We like we can accept, you know, file them. I was thinking of having something in the documentation to say like if you don't.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 16:49  
Um.  
Hmm.  
Yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 17:05  
If you need to file an exception, e-mail this alias.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 17:09  
Yep, Yep, we can do that. We can add a note to the crucial pages like we do for such a lot of the services, so we could.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 17:23  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 17:25  
Add a note, certainly in the overview doc, no the the announcement doc that says hey this is going to happen, but I think we need to also put some information through our onboarding, you know anywhere where.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 17:31  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 17:42  
A customer coming new to the product will not be able to.  
Um, follow the the steps in the article. So like all of the onboarding content.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 17:53  
Would it? Would it be worth adding it into the banner that you previously had in the docs?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 18:03  
Mhm. Yep.  
Yep, I can do that and I can expand. I can extend the number of documents that that banner applies to.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 18:13  
Yeah, yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 18:16  
Yeah. OK, so.  
Let me, it's the 28th already. Let me work on that today or maybe tomorrow and and then we can get it published at a specific time.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 18:24  
No.  
And.  
Yeah, and I know, I know this is tight, so feel free to ping me whenever.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 18:35  
OK.  
No, it's fine. I should have thought about it too, eh? So yeah, the the big question that I have is what parts.  
Uh.  
Going to be changing because we've talked about this in fairly general terms, but wait, let me bring up this.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 19:05  
Yes, I have. I actually just made a video demo showing the private preview experience. I think this will help.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 19:12  
Oh, brilliant.  
Mhm.  
Yeah.  
So this is the private preview experience. Fantastic. Um.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 19:31  
Yep.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 19:34  
So maybe I'll go watch that and I'll come back to you with questions afterwards.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 19:40  
Yep, feel free to ping me and you don't have to wait until the next call.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 19:42  
Yeah. Oh, no, no.  
OK.  
So really what I'm asking I think is.  
If if we're saying that the core workflows and value props.  
6.  
Thanks. Remain intact. Can we?  
So.  
Sorry, what I'm trying to get out is what bit's actually changing? Because if we take the the beginning as being creating your dev center, you're still doing that through as your portal, right?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image4.png" alt-text="":::**  **
20:36  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 20:41  
Yes, all resource creation essentially is still in the Azure portal. For the private preview experience, pretty much everything is in Azure. We to the point that WCX is not helping us develop any of this.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 20:42  
OK.  
But.  
OK.  
They're not being very friendly, are they? Bless them.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 20:58  
No, we're recording, I guess. Now everyone knows.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 21:04  
Yeah, uh, so.  
For the private preview, what part is changing? Do we spin up a dev box through the Windows 365 portal or something like that? I don't. That's the bit I'm missing. I don't have that kind of.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 21:21  
There won't be any self-serve or customizations in the private preview. Those are the two big changes, so we're going to be setting up all of the dev boxes on behalf for them.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 21:22  
Info.  
OK.  
Right.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 21:37  
You'll see it in the video, but we'll end up using intra groups to assign the project assignment and then all of the folks in the intra group will be given a dev box once the provisioning policy is created and then.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 21:40  
Mhm.  
OK.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 21:53  
Team like team customizations are not there. User customizations are not there. It's very bare bones this experience. Like we I I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of our customers don't want to dog food this, but he wanted to show enough of the experience to like.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 22:00  
Mm-hmm.  
Yeah.  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 22:12  
Let them know that the experience is still pretty much like all in Azure and there isn't gonna be a big lift and shift to WCX.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 22:18  
OK.  
OK.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 22:23  
Yeah, so that's what the video kind of shows, I'd say.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 22:26  
Mhm.  
So I guess my key question then is we've, we've got kind of three kinds of customers, I guess current customers who are just kind of continuing as they were. We've got the customers that you described earlier who are.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 22:37  
Mhm.  
Mm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 22:47  
Maybe doing a little bit of a pilot, maybe a little bit of a POC, trying to figure out if they want to commit or not, and those guys might request an exception.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 22:54  
Mhm.  
Hmm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 22:58  
So we need to give them a link to either an e-mail that you were talking about or maybe to a form that can gather some of the initial information from them. So something of that nature. And then we've got a third type of customer who's the brand new customer just heard about Devbox and really wants to try it out.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 23:03  
Yeah.  
Yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 23:18  
Out. But on the 2nd of November, they hit a problem of what? They come to the Azure portal. They can't create anything. They're like, this is nuts. What do they do?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 23:31  
Mhm.  
I think their two options are to either wait until the private preview or add themselves to the exception list.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 23:40  
OK.  
OK. So really for brand new customers, dev box is kind of going dark. I wouldn't really expect many people to pick it up at this stage until we're through private preview. We've expanded some of the functionality of preview and we're.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 23:57  
Yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 24:03  
The in public preview or we're, you know, super close to public preview. Does that kind of make sense?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 24:10  
Yeah, it's on pause. I to be honest when I like.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 24:13  
Hmm.  
Mm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 24:18  
I'm not sure if I fully understand this business decision since it wasn't my decision to make. Like I I guess it helps because we don't want too many customers to be onboarding onto the old service and deploying without.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 24:22  
Mhm.  
Mhm.  
In that.  
Yeah. And then having to change over, yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 24:38  
I I guess it serves as a barrier to entry.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 24:45  
Yeah, OK.  
But do you think that I have captured the the types of customers we're going to need to deal with during this sort of November, December through to Bill, Yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 25:02  
Yep.  
I believe so. It's the customers that are already there in the subscription. They already have a subscription. The customers who are in, yes, they can carry on as normal. They're the customers who have who are in this.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 25:05  
OK.  
Mhm.  
And they can carry on as normal, right?  
Mm-hmm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 25:20  
Limbo stage where maybe they've already like they've been talking to customer reps like you know, like Schaeffler is like a customer in this position, like they're in a POC stage, but they're very involved with Dev Box at this point.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 25:24  
Mhm.  
Yeah.  
Mhm, mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 25:35  
And they're one of our whales. We're even considering them as a as a whale, but.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 25:40  
Mm-hmm. So they that type of customer can request an exception.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 25:43  
Like.  
Yes, they can file an exception and I think they might have already talked to us and we have them on our list. Um. And then we have um.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 25:48  
Mhm.  
Yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 25:57  
The the customers who?  
Are not one of those customers who I think they should be allowed to send an e-mail to us, but we might want to evaluate them.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 26:09  
Mhm.  
Yeah, you can request to join the private preview at this e-mail and note the word request because you're not necessarily going to get on, OK.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 26:16  
Yeah, mm-hmm.  
Mm.  
Mhm.  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 26:27  
Good. OK. What I'll do then is I will go back to that banner that we had for the the crucial documents. I'll see how I can expand it and send you over a draft and then.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 26:44  
Cool.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 26:44  
You can figure out whether you're going to do emails or forms or some different type of way of getting customers to communicate if they want an exception or if they want to join the private preview, and then we can.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 26:59  
Yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 27:01  
Get it set up to to publish. Um.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 27:04  
Do you have thoughts on whether an e-mail or a form is better? I was thinking e-mail and like sending all of the communications in a single alias and potentially once they send the first e-mail a form coming out.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 27:05  
I guess.  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 27:22  
But I'm curious if you think directly a form might be better.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 27:23  
Mhm.  
Um.  
I think it really depends on how many requests you think you're going to have. Because if you're not, if if you set up an e-mail, then you know who's monitoring the alias? Who? Who gets the fun job of responding to everything?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 27:38  
Mhm.  
Probably me.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 27:49  
Yeah, and then, you know, if you set up a form, then you know you can make it fairly open and allow them to to type loads of text and whatnot.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 28:01  
Mhm.

But you can also gather some of that initial information before you respond to them. So I don't know, I I would tend to take some info first, otherwise you will get massively inconsistent requests from folks.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 28:09  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 28:23  
The problem then is, you know, do you have a way of deciding who's going to get to have an exception and who's not? And can you kind of put that into the form?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 28:24  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 28:41  
So that when you read it, you already have a good idea of whether you're going to give these folks an exception or no.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 28:47  
Mhm. Yeah, OK.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 28:49  
So I don't know if if it's going to be you that's reading them, it's totally up to you. I would tend to gather information on that first hit, but it would require or it would work better if you kind of knew what your decision points were going to be and what information you wanted to get.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 28:55  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 29:08  
Java.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 29:09  
Hmm. Yeah, let me.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 29:10  
Does that make any sense at all?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 29:13  
But that doesn't make sense me.  
Yeah, I think we need to talk about the criteria for.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 29:18  
This is.  
Yeah, there's no point in asking them, you know, how many cats they've got, if that's completely irrelevant to the decision.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 29:24  
Option 2.  
Hmm.  
Yep. Mhm.  
OK, yeah.  
Cool. Uh.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 29:41  
Neat.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 29:42  
Yeah, so those, I think those are the two. Those are the two topics I wanted to bring up to Rose. I can. I'll get back to you on what my what my specific alias is if I pick up an alias or.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 29:46  
Mhm.  
Yeah, sure. I'll just, I'll probably put this aside to work on tomorrow, but I'll ping you a draft before I do anything with it and that will give us a chance to earn out the wording and add whatever appropriate.  
E-mail alias or AKA link or whatever it is you want to use.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 30:12  
Mhm.  
OK, sounds good.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 30:18  
Cool. I have a couple of questions before you disappear.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 30:20  
Yep.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 30:22  
And firstly, remind me, what the heck were we doing with the career on behalf of Doc? I remember we talked about it, but honestly my mind is a complete blank as to what we decided.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 30:33  
Not a big deal because I think we decided to de prioritize that item, yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 30:37  
Cool. OK, we were waiting to see if you got some feedback for the blog as well, weren't we?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 30:49  
Yes, yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 30:49  
And we had Roger's document.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 30:53  
Yep.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 30:53  
Which I was going to go through in more detail as well, but yeah, I can push that for another month. Um.  
And then the refresher, the concepts docs. I've done some stuff basically reducing the the number of articles we've got. So the key concepts doc, which was getting way out of date, I've updated and I've merged into the architecture doc.  
So that kind of works and I'm looking at the overview doc today and and trying to update, look at where we need to update diagrams and where we need to, you know, make a bigger deal about customizations and.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 31:17  
Mhm.  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 31:34  
Some of the other new features that have come out in the last 18 months or so.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 31:39  
Mhm.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 31:40  
So that's what I've been up to. Like I said the other day, I I wouldn't mind somebody to just give a quick skim of the concepts docs once they've been done. But of course everybody's super busy just now, but I'll send them over to you and if you have a.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 31:55  
OK.  
Sounds good.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 32:00  
Chance to have a read, then do so and feel free to pass them to other folks as well, because we probably should update those. And that's it. All right.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 32:02  
Good.  
OK.  
OK, sounds good. Would something like Friday work to look at that doc?

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 32:12  
Oh yeah, yeah, that'd be fine.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 32:15  
OK, cool. Sounds good then.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image2.png" alt-text="":::**  
Rose Malcolm** 32:16  
All right, great. Good to talk to you and ping me if you have any new stuff about that family subscription or if it's just driving you crazy and I'll we can try and work it out together, yeah.

:::image type="content" source="media/rose-_-varsha-onboarding-docs_transcript/image3.png" alt-text="":::**  
Varsha Iyer** 32:26  
Cool.
