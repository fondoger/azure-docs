Take the following steps if you're returning the device in Korea.

1. Pack the device for return shipment in the original box.
2. Power off the device and remove the cables.
3. Spool and securely place the power cord that was provided with the device in the back of the device.
4. Write your company name and address information on the consignment note as your sender information.
5. Email adbops@microsoft.com using the following template: 
    * If you have multiple orders, email to ensure individual pickup.

    ```
    To: adbops@microsoft.com
    Subject: Microsoft Azure return shipment Pickup | [Order Name] 
    Body:
    -  Name:
    -  Contact Number:
    -  Collection Address:
    -  Preferred Collection Date and Time:
    ```
6. Print two copies of the reverse shipping label. Affix one label to the outside of the package. Use the second label to obtain a signature from the carrier team as acknowledgment.
7. If you encounter pickup issues:
   * Contact Azure Data Box Operations at adbops@microsoft.com for assistance.
   * Include the Order Name and a description of the issue in the subject line.
8. Once the device is picked up and scanned by the carrier, the order status in the Azure portal will update to “Picked Up” and a tracking ID will be displayed.
