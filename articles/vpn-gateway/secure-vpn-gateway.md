# Secure your VPN Gateway deployment

Azure VPN Gateway provides secure, encrypted connections between your on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks, or between Azure virtual networks. It supports both site-to-site and point-to-site VPN connections using industry-standard IPsec/IKE protocols. Since VPN Gateway serves as a critical entry point for network traffic, securing it properly is essential for protecting your entire Azure infrastructure and maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.

This article provides guidance on how to best secure your VPN Gateway deployment.

## Network security

Network security for VPN Gateway involves implementing multiple layers of protection to secure both the gateway infrastructure and the traffic flowing through it. Proper network segmentation, access controls, and traffic filtering help prevent unauthorized access and protect against external threats.

- **Implement network segmentation with virtual networks**: Deploy VPN Gateway in a well-designed virtual network architecture that follows enterprise segmentation principles. Isolate high-risk systems within their own virtual networks and ensure proper network boundaries align with your business risk profile. For more information, see [Azure Virtual Network overview](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview).

- **Secure traffic with Network Security Groups**: Apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) to restrict and control traffic between internal resources based on your application and enterprise segmentation strategy. Use a "deny by default, permit by exception" approach for highly secure environments. For more information, see [Network security groups](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).

- **Enhance protection with Azure Firewall**: Deploy Azure Firewall alongside your VPN Gateway to provide centralized network-layer protection for your cloud environment. Azure Firewall helps filter traffic between subnets and virtual machines while supporting high availability and scalability. For more information, see [Azure Firewall overview](/azure/firewall/overview).

- **Enable DDoS protection**: Activate Azure DDoS Standard protection on your virtual networks to defend against distributed denial-of-service attacks. DDoS protection offers real-time detection and automatic mitigation to protect your VPN Gateway and other critical resources. For more information, see [Azure DDoS Protection Standard overview](/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview).

- **Use adaptive network hardening**: Implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud's adaptive network hardening recommendations to optimize your NSG configurations. This service analyzes traffic patterns and provides recommendations to limit ports and source IPs based on actual usage. For more information, see [Adaptive network hardening in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/adaptive-network-hardening).

- **Connect private networks securely**: Use Azure ExpressRoute in combination with VPN Gateway to create private connections between Azure datacenters and on-premises infrastructure. ExpressRoute connections don't traverse the public internet, offering more reliability, faster speeds, and lower latencies than typical internet connections. For more information, see [ExpressRoute and VPN Gateway coexistence](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-coexist-resource-manager).

- **Configure route-based VPN for enhanced security**: Use route-based VPN gateways instead of policy-based gateways to support advanced features like custom IPsec/IKE policies, BGP routing, and multiple tunnel connections. Route-based gateways provide better security options and flexibility for complex network topologies. For more information, see [About VPN Gateway configuration settings](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateway-settings).

- **Implement active-active gateway configuration**: Deploy VPN Gateway in active-active mode to ensure high availability and eliminate single points of failure. This configuration provides redundancy and maintains connectivity during maintenance or unexpected failures. For more information, see [About highly available connectivity](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-highlyavailable).

## Identity management

Identity management for VPN Gateway focuses on implementing secure authentication mechanisms and centralizing identity controls. Proper identity management ensures that only authorized users and devices can establish VPN connections while maintaining seamless access experiences.

This ensures consistent identity governance across Microsoft Cloud resources including Azure portal, Azure Storage, virtual machines, and Key Vault, as well as your organization's applications. For more information, see [What is Microsoft Entra ID?](/entra/fundamentals/what-is-entra).

- **Configure Microsoft Entra ID authentication for point-to-site VPN**: Enable Microsoft Entra ID authentication for P2S VPN connections to provide single sign-on capabilities and centralized user management. This allows users to authenticate using their organizational credentials and supports conditional access policies. For more information, see [Configure Microsoft Entra ID authentication for point-to-site VPN](/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-entra-gateway).

- **Implement certificate-based authentication**: Use certificate-based authentication as an additional or alternative authentication method for point-to-site VPN connections. This provides strong authentication without relying solely on usernames and passwords, enhancing security for remote access scenarios. For more information, see [Configure certificate authentication for point-to-site VPN](/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-certificate-gateway).

- **Support multiple authentication types**: Configure multiple authentication types for point-to-site VPN to provide flexibility while maintaining security. This allows you to combine Microsoft Entra ID authentication with certificate-based authentication based on different user requirements and risk profiles. For more information, see [Configure multiple authentication types for point-to-site VPN](/azure/vpn-gateway/howto-point-to-site-multi-auth).

## Privileged access

Privileged access management for VPN Gateway ensures that administrative access to gateway resources is properly controlled and monitored. This includes implementing role-based access controls, just-in-time access principles, and secure administrative practices.

- **Apply least privilege with Azure RBAC**: Use Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to VPN Gateway resources with the minimum necessary permissions. Assign built-in roles when possible and create custom roles only when required to meet specific organizational needs. For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

- **Use secure administrative workstations**: Access VPN Gateway management functions from highly secured, isolated workstations to protect against credential theft and administrative compromise. Deploy privileged access workstations (PAWs) using Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, or Microsoft Intune for centralized management. For more information, see [Privileged access workstations deployment](/security/privileged-access-workstations/privileged-access-deployment).

- **Monitor privileged activities**: Ensure all privileged actions related to VPN Gateway management are logged and monitored for security analysis. Use Microsoft Entra ID audit logs and Azure activity logs to track administrative changes and detect suspicious behavior. For more information, see [Audit activity reports in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-audit-logs).

- **Implement identity governance reviews**: Conduct regular access reviews for users and groups with elevated permissions to VPN Gateway resources. Use Microsoft Entra ID identity governance features to automate periodic reviews and ensure that access remains appropriate over time. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra access reviews](/entra/id-governance/access-reviews-overview).
