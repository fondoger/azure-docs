The default value is false, which means the fallback application type is confidential client such as a web app. There are certain scenarios where Microsoft Entra ID can't determine the client application type. For example, the ROPC flow where it's configured without specifying a redirect URI. In those cases, Microsoft Entra ID interprets the application type based on the value of this property.  |

Additional values can be added to hybrid applications. These values can be used to identify the permissions exposed by this app within Microsoft Entra ID. For example, Client apps can specify a resource URI that is based on the values of this property to acquire an access token, which is the URI returned in the "aud" claim. The any operator is required for filter expressions on multi-valued properties.

| servicePrincipalType                 | String            | String       | NVARCHAR(MAX)   | Identifies whether the service principal represents an application, a managed identity, or a legacy application. This is set by Microsoft Entra ID internally. The servicePrincipalType property can be set to three different values: Application - A service principal that represents an application or service. The appId property identifies the associated app registration, and matches the appId of an application, possibly from a different tenant. If the associated app registration is missing, tokens aren't issued for the service principal. ManagedIdentity - A service principal that represents a managed identity. Service principals representing managed identities can be granted access and permissions, but can't be updated or modified directly. Legacy - A service principal that represents an app created before app registrations, or through legacy experiences. A legacy service principal can have credentials, service principal names, reply URLs, and other properties that are editable by an authorized user, but doesn't have an associated app registration. The appId value doesn't associate the service principal with an app registration. The service principal can only be used in the tenant where it was created. SocialIdp - For internal use.     |

| _SnapshotTime                     | TimestampMicros   | DateTime     | DATETIME2(7)    | The timestamp (in microseconds) indicating when the snapshot of the data was taken. Useful for point-in-time analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| _ReceivedTime                     | TimestampMicros   | DateTime     | DATETIME2(7)    | The timestamp (in microseconds) when the system received the data. Helps track data ingestion latency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| TimeGenerated                     | TimestampMicros   | DateTime     | DATETIME2(7)    | The timestamp (in microseconds) when the data was originally generated at the source. Important for event sequencing and time-based analytics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
