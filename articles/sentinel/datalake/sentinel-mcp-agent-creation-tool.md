The agent creation tool collection in the Microsoft Sentinel Model Context Protocol (MCP) server lets you create effective Microsoft Security Copilot agents. 

## Prerequisites

To access the agent creation tool collection, you must have the following prerequisites:
- [Microsoft Sentinel data lake](sentinel-lake-onboarding.md)
- [Security Copilot](/copilot/security/microsoft-security-copilot)
- Visual Studio Code (latest version)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) Visual Studio Code extension

## Add the agent creation collection

To add the agent creation collection, you must first set up add Microsoft Sentinel's unified MCP server interface. Follow the step-by-step instructions for the following [AI-powered code editors and agent-building platforms](sentinel-mcp-get-started.md#add-microsoft-sentinels-collection-of-mcp-tools):
- Visual Studio Code

The agent creation collection is hosted in the following URL:
- `https://sentinel.microsoft.com/mcp/security-copilot-agent-creation`

After adding the agent creation tool, you can use the following sample prompt to create complex, agentic workflows in Security Copilot:

- Create an agent that generates a comprehensive post-incident report from Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Purview, and Microsoft Sentinel incidents; aggregates incident summaries, detailed insights, entities, and alerts; and provides actionable remediation steps.

## Tools in the agent creation collection

### Search for tools (`search_for_tools`)
This tool finds relevant tools, including skills, agents and MCP tools, in Security Copilot that can be used to fulfill the intent.

| Parameters | Required? | Description | 
|----------|----------|----------|
| userQuery| Yes |The query or problem statement to find relevant tools for (for example, "Defender incident details"). |

### Start agent creation (`start_agent_creation`)
This tool creates a new Security Copilot session to start building a new agent.

| Parameters | Required? | Description | 
|----------|----------|----------|
| userQuery| Yes |The problem statement for the agent. |

 
### Compose agent (`compose_agent`)
This tool iterates on composing the Security Copilot agent YAML.

| Parameters | Required? | Description | 
|----------|----------|----------|
| sessionID| Yes |Security Copilot session identifier created by the `start_agent_creation` tool. This shouldn't be the session identifier created by `search_for_tools`. |
| userQuery| Yes |User input for the tool to process. This could be confirmations, clarifications, or additional information. |
| existingDefinition| No |Optional existing agent definition YAML for the tool to edit. This could be generated from this tool's previous runs or provided by adding a YAML file to the context. |

### Get evaluation (`get_evaluation`)
This tool is called after running the `search_for_tools`, `start_agent_creation`, and `compose_agent` tools to retrieve the result.

| Parameters | Required? | Description | 
|----------|----------|----------|
| sessionID| Yes |Session identifier of the evaluation |
| promptID| Yes |Prompt identifier of the evaluation |
| evaluationID| Yes |The identifier of the evaluation |

### Deploy agent (`deploy_agent`)
This tool uploads the agent to the Security Copilot user or workspace scope.

| Parameters | Required? | Description | 
|----------|----------|----------|
| agentDefinition| Yes |Agent definition in YAML format. This could be generated from the `compose_agent` tool or provided by adding a YAML file to the context. |
