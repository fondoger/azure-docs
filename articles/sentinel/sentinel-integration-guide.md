# Build and publish Microsoft Sentinel solutions

 Microsoft Sentinel SIEM and platform includes a range of capabilities that partners can use to create impactful solutions they can publish through the Microsoft Security Store or the Sentinel SIEM Content Hub. By building on top of Sentinel, partners can enable new scenarios that use a wide breadth of security data, processing capabilities, and AI experiences, without needing new pipelines, processing capabilities or storage infrastructure.

For example, you can create a connector to bring new data into Sentinel, analyze that data with Sentinel Jupyter notebook jobs, and create an agent that uses MCP tools to analyze the new data along with other data already in the lake. The agent can then interact with other endpoints and external applications to deliver a powerful unified experience to your customers.  

## Learn about Microsoft Sentinel

To get started, learn about Microsoft Sentinel, identify the data and functionality you want to create, and find the resources to help you learn about the different capabilities that will help you build solutions that keep your customers secure.

|Step| Description|
|--|--|
|**Learn about Sentinel**| The Sentinel platform includes a data lake, graph, and MCP server.<br><br> The SIEM is a scalable, cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) application that delivers an intelligent and comprehensive solution for SIEM and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR). It provides cyberthreat detection, investigation, response, and proactive hunting, with a bird's-eye view across your enterprise.<br><br> Data lake, graph, and MCP capabilities give developers the ability to create solutions that can use tools from Sentinel’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to extract insights from any Sentinel data.<br><br> For more information, see:<br>[What is Microsoft Sentinel?](/azure/sentinel/overview)|

|**Create an offer**|Once you have a solution package, you’re ready to create an offer in the Security Store or Marketplace. For more information on how to publish your solution, see the following resources. <br><br> For more information, see:<br> [Publish Solutions to Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/publish-sentinel-solutions)|
|**Test Offer Preview**| We create a version of your offer that is accessible only to the preview audience you specified. Creating a preview offer ensures that specific audiences test your solution before your solution is broadly shared with all customers. We recommend keeping your solution in preview for at least four weeks to gather feedback from customers and address any issues that arise.   <br><br> For more information, see:<br> [Status of Microsoft Sentinel solution after publishing in the Microsoft Partner center](/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solutions-post-publish-tracking)|
|**Fix certification issues**|Offers submitted to the commercial marketplace must be certified before being published. If your offer fails any of the checks or if you aren't eligible to submit an offer of that type, a certification failure report is sent to your email address. The errors also show up within Action Center in Partner Center. For more information, see [Certification issues](/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solutions-post-publish-tracking#step-4-certification). After the issues are fixed, you can resubmit the offer for certification. This triggers the review process again and once the offer passes certification. Your solution is published to the marketplace and available for customers in Microsoft Sentinel content hub within two working days.|
|**Make the offer broadly available**|Ensure that you validated all aspects of your solution in preview phase before you make the offer live.
