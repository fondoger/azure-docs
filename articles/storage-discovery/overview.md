# What is Azure Storage Discovery?

**Azure Storage Discovery** is a fully managed service that provides enterprise-wide visibility into your Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage estate. In a single pane of glass you can understand and analyze how your data estate evolved over time, optimize costs, enhance security, and drive operational efficiency.

Azure Storage Discovery integrates with Copilot in Azure, enabling you to unlock insights and accelerate decision-making without utilizing any query language.

Whether you're shaping cloud strategy or safeguarding data, Azure Storage Discovery gives you instant clarity on your Blob Storage estate.
From architecture to governance, it delivers fast answers that help you take control of your Azure data landscape.

- Measure how much data is stored across all storage accounts.
- Identify regions experiencing the highest growth.
- Find opportunities to reduce costs by locating infrequently used data.
- Assess whether storage configurations align with security and compliance best practices.

## Gain advanced storage insights

Track how your Azure Storage estate is evolving and uncover hidden opportunities to reduce costs, boost performance, and tighten security. Azure Storage Discovery reveals underused data, throttling risks, and ways to optimize spending.
These insights are powered by metrics related to storage capacity (object size and object count), activity on the data estate (transactions, ingress, egress), aggregation of transaction errors and detailed configurations for data protection, cost optimization, and security.

### Interactive reports

Your Discovery resource in the Azure portal offers intuitive reports that reveal trends, highlight top storage accounts, and link directly to the resources behind each chart. Quickly spot patterns, surface key accounts, and jump straight to the dataâ€”all from your Discovery dashboard in Azure.
Filter reports by region, redundancy, performance, encryption, and more to focus on the most relevant parts of your data estate.

### Organization-wide visibility

Flexible scoping allows you to gather insights for multiple business groups, workloads, or groupings of resources that are meaningful to you. Analyze up to 1 million storage accounts spread across different subscriptions, resource groups, and regions within a single workspace. The ability to drill down and filter data allows you to quickly obtain actionable insights for optimizing your data estate.

### Adding Storage Discovery is simple

**Fully managed service** 
The Discovery service computes and hosts your insights. No other infrastructure needs to be deployed or paid for.

**No impact on storage resources**
Your Azure Storage resources (like storage accounts) experience no transactions or performance impact when analyzing them with Azure Storage Discovery.

**History provided, right from the start.**
Historical data is added automatically, once you deploy a Discovery workspace. All insights are retained for up to 18 months. History and retention depend on the [pricing plan](pricing.md) you choose.

**Free and paid pricing plans**
Azure Storage Discovery offers free and paid pricing plans for each workspace. The [pricing article](pricing.md) describes the differences and explains what influences the bill when choosing a paid option.

## From insight to action with Azure Storage Discovery

Azure Storage Discovery simplifies the process of uncovering and analyzing insights from thousands of storage accounts, transforming complexity into clarity with just a few clicks. 

### 1. Use the reports

When you deploy Storage Discovery, you get a resource called a *Storage discovery workspace* in one of your resource groups. The [deployment planning](deployment-planning.md) and [workspace creation](create-workspace.md) articles have more details.
Open your workspace, then navigate to the reports. You can adjust your scope to look at a portion of your storage estate, filter whole reports or pivot individual graphs to mine for insights that are relevant and actionable for you. For instance, focus on security or cost relevant insights first.

### 2. Pivot to a list of resources

Every chart in the Discovery reports can be translated into a list of the storage resources that fuel this visualization.
You can navigate from a chart to a browse view.

### 3. Taking action

By browsing resources, you navigate directly to an individual resource for a configuration change. 
Alternatively, you can save the resource list as a *\*.csv* file and use it for bulk operations, like in scripts or terraform.
