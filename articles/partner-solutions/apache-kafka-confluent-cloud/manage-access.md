# Manage users and user permissions in a Confluent organization

An organization admin can add, view, and remove users and roles inside a Confluent organization in the Azure portal. By managing user permissions, you can ensure that only authorized users can access and complete actions on your Confluent Cloud resources on Azure.

Complete the steps described in the next sections to manage users and roles in Apache Kafka & Apache Flink on Confluent Cloud, an Azure Native Integrations service.

You can complete these actions in the Azure portal:

* Add a user to your Confluent organization.
* View a user's role permissions in your Confluent organization.
* Add or remove role permissions assigned to a user in your Confluent organization.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
* A Confluent organization.
* The Owner or Contributor role for the Azure subscription.
* At least AccountAdmin permissions for your Confluent organization.

## Add a user

To add a user to a Confluent organization:

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Confluent organization.
1. In the left pane, under **Confluent entity management**, select **Account and Access**. A list of users who belong to the Confluent organization appears.

   > [!TIP]
   > If the error message "You do not have enough permissions on the organization to perform this operation" appears, make sure that you have the required permissions. You must be assigned the Owner or Contributor role for the Azure subscription.

1. Select **Add User**.

A notification indicates that the user is added. The newly added user is listed on the **Confluent Account and Access** page and in the Confluent portal.

## View a user's permissions

To review the permissions assigned to a user for a Confluent resource:

1. In the Azure portal, go to the **Confluent Account and Access** page to view the list of users in your Confluent organization.
1. To the right of the user whose permissions you want to view, select **Manage Permissions**.
1. View the user permissions in the pane that opens. A newly added user doesn't have any permission in the Confluent organization yet.

Optionally, you can select the chevron (**>**) next to the organization to expand user permissions for all environments and clusters in your Confluent organization.
