# Quickstart: Start a free trial

A 30-day free trial of Azure Native Dynatrace Service is available on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/dynatrace.dynatrace_portal_integration?tab=Overview). You can sign up for the trial plan published by Dynatrace. During the trial period, you can create a Dynatrace resource on Azure and use integrated services like log forwarding, metrics integration, and agent-based monitoring. Before the free trial expires, you can seamlessly upgrade to a paid public plan or a private offer that's customized for your organization.

Before you proceed, make sure that your subscription is enabled for Azure Marketplace purchases. For more information, see [Purchase validation checks](/marketplace/purchase-validation-checks).

## Subscribe to a free trial  

You can access the trial plan by finding Azure Native Dynatrace Service on the Azure portal or in Azure Marketplace. For more information, see [Get started with Dynatrace](dynatrace-create.md#find-offer). Choose the free trial public plan when you subscribe.
