# Incident management tools used by agents in Azure SRE Agent (preview)

Azure SRE Agent leverages a comprehensive suite of specialized incident management tools to automate incident response, troubleshooting, and site reliability engineering tasks.

The tools are designed to handle various scenarios including:

- **Incident Management**: Acknowledge, manage, and track incidents across ICM and PagerDuty
- **Resource Monitoring**: Analyze performance metrics, health status, and configuration changes
- **Diagnostic Operations**: Collect logs, analyze memory dumps, and perform deep system analysis  
- **Infrastructure Management**: Scale resources, modify configurations, and manage network settings
- **Integration Capabilities**: Interface with GitHub, Grafana, and other development tools

Each tool is purpose-built for specific SRE workflows and provides detailed information to help diagnose and resolve issues efficiently. The tools operate with appropriate security contexts and permissions to ensure safe and authorized operations.

## Available tools
