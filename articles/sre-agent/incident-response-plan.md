# Incident response plans in Azure SRE Agent Preview

An Azure SRE Agent incident response plans allows you to define how incidents are detected, reviewed, and mitigated within your environment. When you define custom plans, you tailor the agentâ€™s response to incidents, set autonomy levels, and provide custom instructions for how the agent resolves issues. You can choose between either semi-autonomous and fully autonomous operations, depending on your needs.

Within an incident response plan, you can customize your plan in the following ways:

- **Filters** allow you to decide which incidents a plan runs against.

- **Execution mode** describes the autonomy level of the incident response plan.

- **Customize instructions** allow you to customize the response plan initially generated by the agent.  

## How incident response plans work

When Azure SRE Agent detects an incident in your environment, the incident management tools step in to help you resolve issues as fast as possible. The agent can provide context and elevate incidents to your team to resolve manually, or the agent can work to resolve issues on your behalf. The behavior of the agent depends entirely on how you configure the incident response plan.

## Default settings

When you enable incident management, by default all incidents are processed using the following plan details:

- Connected to Azure Monitor alerts
- Processes all low priority incidents from all impacted services
- Runs in review mode

While this configuration represents the defaults, you can customize everything from the incident management system to the filters and autonomy level. Supported incident management platforms include PagerDuty and ServiceNow.

## Customize a response plan

You can create custom instructions through selecting management services, applying filters, setting autonomy level, and customizing the prompt context used to process incidents.

### Filter incidents

The following filters are available for you to customize incident plan instructions.

| Filter | Description |
|---|---|
| Incident type | Select the type of incidents you want your plan to process. Options include default, major, and security incidents.  |
| Impacted service | Select the service you want your plan to process. Options include all impacted services, or you can select a service by name. |
| Priority | Select the incident priority level you want your plan to process. |
| Title contains | Provide a text string to match against incident title values. |

### Set autonomy level

Inside an incident response plan, you can choose the autonomy level for the agent.

| Autonomy level | Description | Is default |
|---|---|---|
| Review | In this semi-autonomous mode, the agent diagnoses incidents then mitigates or modifies resources only after you review and approve and the proposed actions. | Yes |
| Autonomous | In this fully autonomous mode, the agent analyzes incidents and independently performs mitigation or resource modifications.<br><br>**Note** : If the agent doesn't have the required permissions to take action, it prompts you to grant temporary access to elevated permissions. | No |

### Define custom instructions

To customize your incident response plan, SRE Agent looks at a series of previous incidents to inspect how they were resolved in the past. After the agent creates a profile based on historical incidents, it generates more detailed context that the agent uses to respond to incidents.

You can customize the generated instructions or replace them with your own instructions. Depending on the contents of the response plan, the agent generates a list of tools it intends to use during an incident response. You can add or remove tools available to the agent based on the plan. As you change the custom instructions, you can regenerate the list of tools to keep them in sync.

## Test a response plan

To ensure your incident response plan behaves the way you expect, you can test your plan against historical issues. In test mode, your plan runs against existing incidents so you can see how the agent attempts to mitigate the issue.

When it test mode, the agent always operates in a read-only mode.

You can test both new and existing incident response plans.

# [New plan](#tab/new-plan)

When creating a new incident response plan, use the following instructions to test your incident response plan.

1. Select the **Add custom instructions** checkbox.

1. Enter your custom instructions into the **Custom instructions** box.

1. Select **Generate**.

1. Review the plan generated by the agent.

1. Select the **Test incident response** tab.

1. From the incident drop-down, select an incident you want to test the plan against.

1. Select **Run test**.

# [Existing plan](#tab/existing-plan)

To test an existing incident response plan, use the following instructions to test your incident response plan.

1. Select the **Incident management** tab.

1. Select the incident response plan from the list.

1. Review the filters and autonomy level settings and select **Next**.

1. Review the incidents list you want to model the plan on, and review the custom instructions.

1. Select **Generate** if you made changes or **Skip** if you didn't adjust any filters or instructions.

1. Select the **Test incident response** tab.

1. From the incident drop-down, select an incident you want to test the plan against.

1. Select **Run test**.

1. Review the response generated by the agent and to verify that you approve with how to agent responds to the incident.
