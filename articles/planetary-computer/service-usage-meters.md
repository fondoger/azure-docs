# Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro service usage meters

Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro offers a pay-as-you-go usage model. You're charged for the resources you consume, providing flexibility and control over your spending. This article details the usage meters for the different components of the service.

## Access usage metrics through the Azure portal

Detailed information about the utilization of your GeoCatalog resource is available in the Azure portal under **Monitoring**>**Metrics** in the resource view.

## Service usage meters

Usage of the service is measured with the following dimensions:

| Meter                       | Measured Units            | Description                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Geospatial Storage**               | GiB-month                  | Ingested data stored after any cloud-optimization and compression.                                         |
| **Geospatial Data Operations**             | 10K operations            | Storage read / metadata retrieval operations (search, list, item/asset metadata access).                   |
| **Ingestion & Transformation** | vCPU-hour                 | Compute consumed transforming data into cloud-optimized formats (for example COG generation) and ingesting data into GeoCatalog.              |
| **Bandwidth**              | GiB                 | Data transferred out of the Azure region hosting the GeoCatalog resource.                                  |

All meters are calculated using binary gigabytes (GiB), where 1 GiB equals 1,073,741,824 bytes. 

### Geospatial Storage

Measured in GiB-month of data stored in your GeoCatalog (original plus derived / optimized forms). Includes any cloud-optimized representations generated by the platform.

### Geospatial Data Operations

Operations are read operations for data that is stored in the managed storage inside a GeoCatalog resource. Common patterns include:
* Use the SAS API to read stored assets.
* Use the Data API to render a tile based on managed data.

Use of the [STAC API](./stac-overview.md) for querying or searching a catalog isn't considered a read operation. 


### Ingestion & Transformation

A virtual CPU (vCPU) hour reflects how much processing power the service spent on your ingestion job. While data is being ingested and transformed, Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro tracks the CPU time consumed by the workers that run your job inside its managed environment. It adds up every second of CPU usage from those workers, converts the total into hours, and reports that number as vCPU-hours for billing.

To estimate your vCPU-hours, choose a data type similar to the one you plan to ingest:
 
| Data Type | Format State | Description (Format / Bands) | Representative vCPU-hours/GiB |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| [Sentinel‑2 L2A](./data-visualization-samples.md#sentinel-2-l2a-collection-configuration) | Non-COG | GeoTIFF; 13 MSI spectral bands (B1–B12 incl. B8A, 10–60 m) plus QA masks | 0.50 |
| Micro COG 1000 | COG | Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (1000 2-10 MB files); Three bands (RGB) | 0.423 |
| Aerial Orthomosaic | Non-COG | Orthorectified GeoTIFF mosaic; Three bands (RGB); large tiles | 0.20 |
| [National Aerial Imagery Program](./data-visualization-samples.md#the-national-agriculture-imagery-program-collection-configuration) | COG | Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF; Four bands (RGB + NIR) | 0.030 |

To estimate your vCPU-hours, select a data type that's similar to the one you plan on ingesting, and multiply the **Representative vCPU-hours/GiB**  value by the number of gigabytes of data you intend to ingest. 

**Example:** Suppose you're ingesting 250 GiB of [National Aerial Imagery Program](./data-visualization-samples.md#the-national-agriculture-imagery-program-collection-configuration) (NAIP) data already in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format. Using the representative value of 0.030 vCPU/GiB from the table:

250 GiB × 0.030 vCPU/GiB = 7.5 vCPU-hours


### Bandwidth

Bandwidth is measured in GiB of data that leave the GeoCatalog’s Azure region. This meter increments alongside read [operations](#geospatial-data-operations) whenever data moves to another Azure region or outside of Azure.

## Cost management

Azure provides tools to help you monitor and manage your spending. You can use [Microsoft Cost Management and Billing](/azure/cost-management-billing/cost-management-billing-overview) to track your Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro usage and costs, set budgets, and receive alerts.
