# US Core

The HL7 US Core Implementation Guide (US Core IG) is a set of rules and best practices that help healthcare providers share patient information safely and efficiently across the United States. The Azure Health Data Services FHIR server supports the following US Core versions:

- [US Core 3.1.1](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/index.html)
- [US Core 6.1.0](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/ImplementationGuide-hl7.fhir.us.core.html)

Please note that the FHIR service does not store any profiles from implementation guides by default. You will need to load them into the FHIR service. Please follow [storing profiles instructions](./fhir/store-profiles-in-fhir.md) to store the relevant profiles for your desired US Core version.
