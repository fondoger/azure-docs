# Deploy an Azure API Management self-hosted gateway to Docker

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-dev](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev.md)]

This article provides the steps for deploying self-hosted gateway component of Azure API Management to a Docker environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Hosting a self-hosted gateway in Docker is best suited for evaluation and development use cases. Kubernetes is recommended for production use. Learn how to deploy a self-hosted gateway to Kubernetes with [Helm](how-to-deploy-self-hosted-gateway-kubernetes-helm.md) or by using a [deployment YAML file](how-to-deploy-self-hosted-gateway-kubernetes.md).

## Prerequisites

- Complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
- Create a Docker environment: [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is a good option for development and evaluation purposes. See [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com) for information on all Docker editions, their features, and comprehensive documentation on Docker itself.
- [Provision a gateway resource in your Azure API Management instance](api-management-howto-provision-self-hosted-gateway.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Self-hosted gateways are packaged as x86-64 Linux-based Docker containers.

## Deploy the self-hosted gateway to Docker

1. Select **Self-hosted gateways** under **Deployment + infrastructure**.
1. Select the gateway resource you want to deploy.
1. Select **Settings** > **Deployment**.
1. Note that an access token in the **Token** text box is autogenerated for you by using the default **Expiry** and **Secret key** values. If needed, pick desired values in either or both controls to generate a new token.
1. Make sure **Docker** is selected under **Deployment scripts**.
1. Select the **env.conf** file link next to the **Environment** to download the file.
1. Select the **Copy** icon located at the right end of the **Run** text box to copy the Docker command to your clipboard.
1. Paste the command to the terminal (or command) window. Adjust the port mappings and container name as needed. The command assumes that the downloaded environment file is present in the current directory.

   ```
   docker run -d -p 80:8080 -p 443:8081 --name <gateway-name> --env-file env.conf mcr.microsoft.com/azure-api-management/gateway:<tag>
   ```

1. Execute the command. The command instructs your Docker environment to run the container by using a [container image](https://aka.ms/apim/shgw/registry-portal) from the Microsoft Artifact Registry, and to map the container's HTTP (8080) and HTTPS (8081) ports to ports 80 and 443 on the host.
1. Run the following command to check if the gateway container is running:

    ```console
    docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                         NAMES
    895ef0ecf13b        mcr.microsoft.com/azure-api-management/gateway:latest   "/bin/sh -c 'dotnet â€¦"   5 seconds ago       Up 3 seconds        0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->8081/tcp   my-gateway
    ```

1. Go back to Azure portal, select **Overview**, and confirm that the self-hosted gateway container you just deployed reports a healthy status.

> [!TIP]
> Use `console docker container logs <gateway-name>` command to view a snapshot of self-hosted gateway log.
>
> Use `docker container logs --help` command to see all log viewing options.
