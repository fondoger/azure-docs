# Enable semantic caching for LLM APIs in Azure API Management

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

Enable semantic caching of responses to LLM API requests to reduce bandwidth and processing requirements imposed on the backend APIs and lower latency perceived by API consumers. With semantic caching, you can return cached responses for identical prompts and also for prompts that are similar in meaning, even if the text isn't the same. For background, see [Tutorial: Use Azure Managed Redis as a semantic cache](../redis/tutorial-semantic-cache.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration steps in this article show how to enable semantic caching for APIs added to API Management from Azure OpenAI in Azure AI Foundry models. You can apply these steps to enable semantic caching for corresponding large language model (LLM) APIs available through the [Azure AI Model Inference API](/rest/api/aifoundry/modelinference/) or with OpenAI-compatible models served through third-party inference providers. 

## Prerequisites

* Add one or more Azure OpenAI in Azure AI Foundry model deployments as APIs to your API Management instance. For more information, see [Add an Azure OpenAI API to Azure API Management](azure-openai-api-from-specification.md).
* Create deployments for the following APIs:

    * Chat Completion API - Deployment used for API consumer calls 
    * Embeddings API - Deployment used for semantic caching
* Configure the API Management instance to use managed identity authentication to the Azure OpenAI APIs. For more information, see [Authenticate and authorize access to Azure OpenAI APIs using Azure API Management ](api-management-authenticate-authorize-azure-openai.md#authenticate-with-managed-identity).
* An [Azure Managed Redis](../redis/quickstart-create-managed-redis.md) instance with the **RediSearch** module enabled on the Redis cache.
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only enable the **RediSearch** module when creating a new  Azure Managed Redis cache. You can't add a module to an existing cache. [Learn more](../redis/redis-modules.md)
* Configure the Azure Managed Redis instance as an external cache in the Azure API Management instance. For steps, see [Use an external Redis-compatible cache in Azure API Management](api-management-howto-cache-external.md).


## Test Chat API deployment

First, test the Azure OpenAI deployment to make sure the Chat Completion API or Chat API works as expected. For steps, see [Import an Azure OpenAI API to Azure API Management](azure-openai-api-from-specification.md#test-the-azure-openai-api).

For example, test the Azure OpenAI Chat API by sending a POST request to the API endpoint with a prompt in the request body. The response should include the completion of the prompt. Example request:

```rest
POST https://my-api-management.azure-api.net/my-api/openai/deployments/chat-deployment/chat/completions?api-version=2024-02-01
```

with request body:

```json
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}
```

When the request succeeds, the response includes a completion for the chat message.

## Create a backend for embeddings API

Create a [backend](backends.md) resource for the embeddings API deployment with the following settings:

* **Name** - A name of your choice, such as *embeddings-backend*. You use this name to reference the backend in policies.
* **Type** - Select **Custom URL**.
* **Runtime URL** - The URL of the embeddings API deployment in Azure OpenAI, similar to: `https://my-aoai.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/embeddings-deployment/embeddings` (without query parameters).

* **Authorization credentials** - Go to **Managed Identity** tab.
  * **Client identity** - Select *System assigned identity* or enter a user-assigned managed identity client ID.
  * **Resource ID** - Enter `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/` for Azure OpenAI.

### Test embeddings backend 

To test the embeddings backend, create an API operation for your Azure OpenAI API:

1. On the **Design** tab of your API, select **+ Add operation**.
1. Enter a **Display name** such as *Embeddings* and optionally a **Name** for the operation.
1. In the **Frontend** section, in **URL**, select **POST** and enter the path `/`.
1. On the **Headers** tab, add a required header with the name `Content-Type` and value `application/json`.
1. Select **Save**.

Configure the following policies in the **Inbound processing** section of the API operation. In the [set-backend-service](set-backend-service-policy.md) policy, substitute the name of the backend you created.

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <set-backend-service backend-id="embeddings-backend" />
        <authentication-managed-identity resource="https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/" />
        [...]
    </inbound>
    [...]
</policies>
```
 
On the **Test** tab, test the operation by adding an `api-version` query parameter with value such as `2024-02-01`. Provide a valid request body. For example:

```json
{"input":"Hello"}
```        

If the request is successful, the response includes a vector representation of the input text. Example response:

```json
{
    "object": "list",
    "data": [{
        "object": "embedding",
        "index": 0,
        "embedding": [
            -0.021829502,
            -0.007157768,
            -0.028619017,
            [...]
        ]
    }]
}

```

## Configure semantic caching policies

To enable semantic caching for Azure OpenAI APIs in Azure API Management, apply the following policies: one to check the cache before sending requests (lookup) and another to store responses for future reuse (store):
* In the **Inbound processing** section for the API, add the [azure-openai-semantic-cache-lookup](azure-openai-semantic-cache-lookup-policy.md) policy. In the `embeddings-backend-id` attribute, specify the Embeddings API backend you created.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When enabling semantic caching for other large language model APIs, use the [llm-semantic-cache-lookup](llm-semantic-cache-lookup-policy.md) policy instead.

    Example:

    ```xml
    <azure-openai-semantic-cache-lookup
        score-threshold="0.1"
        embeddings-backend-id="embeddings-backend"
        embeddings-backend-auth="system-assigned"
        ignore-system-messages="true"
        max-message-count="10">
        <vary-by>@(context.Subscription.Id)</vary-by>
    </azure-openai-semantic-cache-lookup>
    <rate-limit calls="10" renewal-period="60" />
    ```
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE [api-management-cache-availability](../../includes/api-management-cache-availability.md)]
    
* In the **Outbound processing** section for the API, add the [azure-openai-semantic-cache-store](azure-openai-semantic-cache-store-policy.md) policy.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When enabling semantic caching for other large language model APIs, use the [llm-semantic-cache-store](llm-semantic-cache-store-policy.md) policy instead.

    Example:

    ```xml
    <azure-openai-semantic-cache-store duration="60" />
    ```

## Confirm caching

To confirm that semantic caching works as expected, trace a test Completion or Chat Completion operation by using the test console in the portal. Confirm that the cache is used on subsequent tries by inspecting the trace. [Learn more about tracing API calls in Azure API Management](api-management-howto-api-inspector.md). 

Adjust the `score-threshold` attribute in the lookup policy to control how similar the prompts must be to return cached responses. Lower values indicate greater semantic similarity is required to return cached responses.

For example, if the cache is used, the **Output** section includes entries similar to the following screenshot:
