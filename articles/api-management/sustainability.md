# Environmentally sustainable APIs in Azure API Management (preview)

[!INCLUDE [premium-dev-standard-basic.md](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-basic.md)]

This article introduces features in Azure API Management that help you reduce the carbon footprint of your API traffic. Use the features to adjust API traffic based on carbon emissions in different Azure regions.

> [!NOTE]
> * Environmental sustainability features are currently in limited preview. To sign up, [complete the form](https://aka.ms/apim/sustainability/preview/join). 
> * These features are currently available in [select regions](#region-availability) in the Azure API Management classic tiers (Developer, Basic, Standard, Premium).

## About sustainable APIs

Organizations are increasingly focused on reducing their environmental impact through their digital infrastructure. 

API Management lets you achieve these goals with features that help:

* [Shift and load-balance API traffic](#traffic-shifting) to backend regions based on their carbon intensity
* [Shape API traffic](#traffic-shaping) based on carbon emissions in your API Management service's region

By optimizing how your APIs handle traffic based on environmental factors, you can:

* Reduce carbon emissions of your API traffic
* Support corporate sustainability initiatives and environmental commitments
* Demonstrate environmental responsibility to stakeholders


## Traffic shifting

Traffic shifting requires configuring a [backend](backends.md) resource in a [supported Azure region](#region-availability) that provides carbon intensity information. Then, in a load-balanced backend pool, specify the maximum acceptable carbon emission level for the regionalized backend, using one of the [carbon intensity categories](#carbon-intensity-categories).

This capability, combined with your existing load balancing and routing strategies, helps you exclude traffic to backends in regions with relatively higher carbon emissions.

At runtime:

* API Management makes a best effort to route traffic to "green" backends (in regions with emissions below your specified thresholds) and excludes "dirty" backends (in regions with emissions above specified thresholds).
* API Management routes traffic to "dirty" backends under certain conditions to ensure service continuity - for example, when all regionalized backends are "dirty", and other backends are unavailable.

### Configuration example

First, configure a backend in a [supported Azure region](#region-availability) by setting the optional `azureRegion` property:

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/backends", 
    "apiVersion": "2024-10-01-preview", 
    "name": "sustainable-backend", 
    "properties": {
        "url": "https://mybackend.example.com",
        "protocol": "http",
        "azureRegion": "westeurope",
        [...]
  }
}
```

Then, use the regionalized backend in a load-balanced pool and define the emission threshold using a `preferredCarbonEmission` property. 

In this example, if the carbon intensity in the `westeurope` region exceeds `Medium`, traffic to the `sustainable-backend` is excluded compared with the other backends in the pool.




```json
{
    [...]
    "properties": {
        "description": "Load balancer for multiple backends",
        "type": "Pool",
        "pool": {
            "services": [
                {
                    "id": "<sustainable-backend-id>",
                    "weight": 1,
                    "priority": 1,
                    "preferredCarbonEmission": "Medium"
                }
                {
                    
                    "id": "<regular-backend-id>",
                    "weight": 1,
                    "priority": 1
                }
                {
                    "id": "<fallback-backend-id>",
                    "weight": 1,
                    "priority": 2
                }
            ]
        }
    }
} 
```

## Traffic shaping

Traffic shaping lets you adjust API behavior based on relative carbon emission levels in your API Management service's region (or regions). API Management exposes the `context.Deployment.SustainabilityInfo.CurrentCarbonIntensity` [context variable](api-management-policy-expressions.md#ContextVariables), which indicates the current [carbon intensity category](#carbon-intensity-categories) for your API Management instance. 

In [multi-region deployments](api-management-howto-deploy-multi-region.md), the gateway provides the carbon intensity of the respective region it runs in.

Use this context variable in your policies to enable more intensive traffic processing during periods of low carbon emissions, or reduce processing during high carbon emissions.

### Example: Adjust behavior in high carbon emission periods

In the following example, API Management extends cache durations, implements stricter rate limiting, and reduces logging detail during high carbon emission periods.

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <choose>
          <when condition="@(context.Deployment.SustainabilityInfo.CurrentCarbonIntensity == CarbonIntensityCategory.High)">
            <!-- Policies for high carbon emission periods -->
            <cache-store duration="3600" />
            <rate-limit-by-key calls="100" renewal-period="60" counter-key="@(context.Request.IpAddress)" />
            <set-variable name="enableDetailedLogging" value="false" />
          </when>
          <when condition="@(context.Deployment.SustainabilityInfo.CurrentCarbonIntensity == CarbonIntensityCategory.Medium)">
            <!-- Policies for medium carbon emission periods -->
            <cache-store duration="1800" />
            <rate-limit-by-key calls="200" renewal-period="60" counter-key="@(context.Request.IpAddress)" />
            <set-variable name="enableDetailedLogging" value="true" />
          </when>
          <otherwise>
            <!-- Policies for low carbon emission periods -->
            <cache-store duration="900" />
            <rate-limit-by-key calls="300" renewal-period="60" counter-key="@(context.Request.IpAddress)" />
            <set-variable name="enableDetailedLogging" value="true" />
          </otherwise>
        </choose>
    
        <!-- Use the logging variable elsewhere -->
        <choose>
          <when condition="@(context.Variables.GetValueOrDefault<bool>("enableDetailedLogging"))">
            <log-to-eventhub logger-id="detailed-logger">
              @{
                  return JObject.FromObject(context).ToString();
              }
            </log-to-eventhub>
          </when>
          <otherwise>
            <log-to-eventhub logger-id="basic-logger">
              @{
                  var log = new JObject();
                  log["requestId"] = context.RequestId;
                  log["method"] = context.Request.Method;
                  log["url"] = context.Request.Url.ToString();
                  log["statusCode"] = context.Response.StatusCode;
                  return log.ToString();
              }
            </log-to-eventhub>
          </otherwise>
        </choose>
    </inbound>
    [...]    
</policies>
```

### Example: Propagate carbon intensity information to backend or in logs

The following example shows how to access the current carbon intensity and propagate it to the backend or in logs.

```xml
<policies>
    [...]
    <outbound>
        <base />
        <set-header name="X-Sustainability-CarbonEmission" exists-action="override">
            <value>@(context.Deployment.SustainabilityInfo.CurrentCarbonIntensity.ToString())</value>
        </set-header>
    </outbound>
    [...]
</policies>
```

### Example: Adjust trace verbosity based on carbon intensity

The following example shows how to use the current carbon intensity information to adjust the amount of information propagated in a custom [trace](trace-policy.md).

```xml
<policies>
    [...]
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <choose>
            <when condition="@(context.Deployment.SustainabilityInfo.CurrentCarbonIntensity >= CarbonIntensityCategory.High)">
                <trace source="Orders API" severity="verbose">
                    <message>Lead Created</message>
                </trace>
            </when>
            <otherwise>
                <trace source="Orders API" severity="information">
                    <message>Lead Created</message>
                </trace>
            </otherwise>
        </choose>
    </inbound>
    [...]    
</policies>
```
