# Authorize access for AzCopy with a user identity

User identity authentication provides a straightforward way to authorize [AzCopy](storage-use-azcopy-v10.md) operations using your personal Microsoft Entra ID credentials. This authentication method is ideal for interactive scenarios where you're manually running AzCopy commands or working in development environments.

This article shows you how to authenticate AzCopy using your user identity through various methods: device code flow with environment variables, the interactive AzCopy login command, or by leveraging existing Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell sessions.

To learn about other ways to authorize access to AzCopy, see [Authorize AzCopy](storage-use-azcopy-v10.md#authorize-azcopy).

## Verify role assignments

Ensure your user identity has the required Azure role for your intended operations:

- **Download operations**: [Storage Blob Data Reader](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-reader) (Blob Storage) or [Storage File Data Privileged Reader](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-file-data-privileged-reader) (Azure Files)

- **Upload operations**: [Storage Blob Data Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-contributor) or [Storage Blob Data Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-owner) (Blob Storage) or [Storage File Data Privileged Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-file-data-privileged-contributor) (Azure Files)

For role assignment instructions, see [Assign an Azure role for access to blob data](../blobs/assign-azure-role-data-access.md) (Blob Storage) or [Choose how to authorize access to file data in the Azure portal](../files/authorize-data-operations-portal.md) (Azure Files).

> [!NOTE]
> Role assignments can take up to five minutes to propagate.

If you're transferring blobs in an account that has a hierarchical namespace, you don't need to have one of these roles assigned to your security principal if your security principal is added to the access control list (ACL) of the target container or directory. In the ACL, your security principal needs write permission on the target directory, and execute permission on container and each parent directory. To learn more, see [Access control model in Azure Data Lake Storage](../blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control-model.md).

## Authorize with environment variables

To authorize access, you'll set in-memory environment variables. Then run any AzCopy command. AzCopy will retrieve the Auth token required to complete the operation. After the operation completes, the token disappears from memory. AzCopy retrieves the OAuth token by using the credentials that you provide.

After you've verified that your user identity has been given the necessary authorization level, type the following command, and then press the ENTER key.

### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export AZCOPY_AUTO_LOGIN_TYPE=DEVICE
```

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```powershell
$Env:AZCOPY_AUTO_LOGIN_TYPE="DEVICE"

```

---

Then, run any azcopy command (For example: `azcopy list https://contoso.blob.core.windows.net`).

This command returns an authentication code and the URL of a website. Open the website, provide the code, and then choose the **Next** button.

A sign-in window will appear. In that window, sign into your Azure account by using your Azure account credentials. After you've successfully signed in, the operation can complete.

## Authorize with the AzCopy login command

As an alternative to using in-memory variables, you authorize access by using the azcopy login command.

The azcopy login command retrieves an OAuth token and then places that token into a secret store on your system. If your operating system doesn't have a secret store such as a Linux keyring, the azcopy login command won't work because there is nowhere to place the token.

After you've verified that your user identity has been given the necessary authorization level, open a command prompt, type the following command, and then press the ENTER key.

```azcopy
azcopy login
```

If you receive an error, try including the tenant ID of the organization to which the storage account belongs.

```azcopy
azcopy login --tenant-id=<tenant-id>
```

Replace the `<tenant-id>` placeholder with the tenant ID of the organization to which the storage account belongs. To find the tenant ID, select **Tenant properties > Tenant ID** in the Azure portal.

This command returns an authentication code and the URL of a website. Open the website, provide the code, and then choose the **Next** button.

![Create a container](media/storage-use-azcopy-v10/azcopy-login.png)

A sign-in window will appear. In that window, sign into your Azure account by using your Azure account credentials. After you've successfully signed in, you can close the browser window and begin using AzCopy.

## Authorize with Azure CLI

If you sign in by using Azure CLI, then Azure CLI obtains an OAuth token that AzCopy can use to authorize operations. 

To enable AzCopy to use that token, type the following command, and then press the ENTER key.

### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export AZCOPY_AUTO_LOGIN_TYPE=AZCLI
export AZCOPY_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
```

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```powershell
$Env:AZCOPY_AUTO_LOGIN_TYPE="AZCLI"

```

## Authorize with Azure PowerShell

If you sign in by using Azure PowerShell, then Azure PowerShell obtains an OAuth token that AzCopy can use to authorize operations.  

To enable AzCopy to use that token, type the following command, and then press the ENTER key.

```PowerShell
$Env:AZCOPY_AUTO_LOGIN_TYPE="PSCRED"
$Env:AZCOPY_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
```
