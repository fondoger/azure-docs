# Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer: Support lifecycle and policy

This article covers the support lifecycle and policy for Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer.

## Update schedule and process

Storage Explorer is released four to six times a year. Microsoft might also release fixes for critical issues.

Storage Explorer checks for updates every hour, and downloads them when they're available. User acceptance is required to start the install process. If you choose to update at a different time, you can manually check for updates by selecting **Help > Check for Updates** from the menu (Windows and Linux) or **Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer > Check for Updates** (macOS). You can also go directly to the [Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) download page to download and install the latest release.

We strongly recommend you always use the latest versions of Storage Explorer. If an issue is preventing you from updating to the latest version of Storage Explorer, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureStorageExplorer).

## Support lifecycle

The [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy) governs Storage Explorer's support lifecycle. Users are expected to keep their installation of Storage Explorer up to date. Staying up to date ensures that you have the latest capabilities, performance enhancements, security, and service reliability.

Starting with version 1.14.1, any Storage Explorer release that's greater than 12 months old is considered out of support. Starting with 1.31.0, a release's age is based on the release date of its minor version. All releases before 1.14.1 will be considered out of support starting July 14, 2021. While a version is in support, Microsoft endeavors to keep the version working as was intended at its release. Once a version is out of support, it's no longer guaranteed to work as intended. For a list of all releases, their release date, and their end of support date, see [Releases](#releases).

Starting with version 1.13.0, an in-app alert might be displayed once a version is approximately one month away from being out of support. The alert encourages you to update to the latest version of Storage Explorer. Once a version is out of support, the in-app alert might be displayed on each start-up.
