# Reliability in Azure Queue Storage

[Azure Queue Storage](/azure/storage/queues/storage-queues-introduction) is a service for storing and distributing large numbers of messages. Queue Storage is commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously and provides reliable message delivery for loosely coupled application architectures. A queue message can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue may contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account.

Azure Queue Storage provides several reliability features through the underlying Azure Storage platform. As part of Azure Storage, Queue Storage inherits the same redundancy options, availability zone support, and geo-replication capabilities that ensure high availability and durability for your message queues. 

This article describes reliability and availability zones support in Azure Queue Storage. For a more detailed overview of reliability in Azure, see [Azure reliability](/azure/reliability/overview).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Queue Storage is part of the Azure Storage platform. Some of the capabilities of Queue Storage are common across many Azure Storage services. In this document, we use "Azure Storage" to indicate these common capabilities.

## Production deployment recommendations

For production environments:

- Enable zone-redundant storage (ZRS) for the storage accounts that contain Queue Storage resources. ZRS provides higher availability by replicating your data synchronously across multiple availability zones in the primary region, protecting against availability zone failures.

- If you need resilience to region outages and your storage account's primary region is paired, consider enabling geo-redundant storage, which replicates data asynchronously to the paired region. In supported regions, you can combine geo-redundancy with zone redundancy by using GZRS.

For advanced messaging requirements, consider using Azure Service Bus. To learn more about the differences between Queue Storage and Azure Service Bus, see [Storage queues and Service Bus queues - compared and contrasted](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-azure-and-service-bus-queues-compared-contrasted).

## Reliability architecture overview

Azure Queue Storage operates as a distributed messaging service within the Azure Storage platform infrastructure. The service provides redundancy through multiple copies of your queue and message data, with the specific redundancy model depending on your storage account configuration.

## Transient faults

[!INCLUDE [Transient fault description](includes/reliability-transient-fault-description-include.md)]

Azure Queue Storage is commonly used in applications to be able to handle transient faults in other components. By using asynchronous messaging with a service like Azure Queue Storage, applications can recover from transient faults by reprocessing messages at a later time. To learn more, see [Asynchronous Messaging Primer](/previous-versions/msp-n-p/dn589781(v=pandp.10)).

Within the service itself, Azure Queue Storage handles transient faults automatically through several mechanisms provided by the Azure Storage platform and client libraries. The service is designed to provide resilient message queuing capabilities even during temporary infrastructure issues.

Azure Queue Storage client libraries include built-in retry policies that automatically handle common transient failures such as network timeouts, temporary service unavailability (HTTP 503), and throttling responses (HTTP 429). When your application encounters these transient conditions, the client libraries automatically retry operations using exponential backoff strategies.

To manage transient faults effectively when using Azure Queue Storage:

- **Configure appropriate timeouts** in your Queue Storage client to balance responsiveness with resilience to temporary slowdowns. The default timeouts in Azure Storage client libraries are typically suitable for most scenarios.
- **Implement circuit breaker patterns** in your application when processing messages from queues to prevent cascading failures when downstream services are experiencing issues.
- **Use visibility timeouts appropriately** when receiving messages to ensure messages become available for retry if your application encounters failures during processing.

## Availability zone support

[!INCLUDE [AZ support description](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]

Azure Queue Storage is zone-redundant when deployed with ZRS configuration, meaning the service spreads replicas of your queue data synchronously across all of the availability zones in the region. This configuration ensures that your queues remain accessible even if an entire availability zone becomes unavailable. All write operations must be acknowledged across multiple zones before completing, providing strong consistency guarantees.

Zone redundancy is enabled at the storage account level and applies to all Queue Storage resources within that account. You cannot configure individual queues for different redundancy levels - the setting applies to the entire storage account. When an availability zone experiences an outage, Azure Storage automatically routes requests to healthy zones without requiring any intervention from your application.

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Availability zone support](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-support-include.md)]

### Region support

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Availability zone region support](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-region-support-include.md)]

### Requirements

You must use a Standard general-purpose v2 storage account to enable zone-redundant storage for Queue Storage. Premium storage accounts don't support Queue Storage.

### Cost

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Availability zone cost](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-cost-include.md)]

For detailed pricing information, see [Azure Queue Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/queues/).

### Configure availability zone support

- **Create a storage account and queue with zone redundancy:**

    1. [Create a storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create) and select ZRS, geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) or read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GZRS) as the redundancy option during account creation.

    1. [Create a queue](/azure/storage/queues/storage-quickstart-queues-portal).

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Configure availability zone support](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-configure-include.md)]

### Normal operations

This section describes what to expect when a queue storage account is configured for zone redundancy and all availability zones are operational.

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Normal operations](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-normal-operations-include.md)]

### Zone-down experience

When an availability zone becomes unavailable, Azure Queue Storage automatically handles the failover process with the following behavior:

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Zone down experience](includes/storage/reliability-storage-availability-zone-down-experience-include.md)]

- **Traffic rerouting.** Azure automatically reroutes traffic to the remaining healthy availability zones. The service maintains full functionality using the surviving zones with no customer intervention required.

### Considerations

When implementing multi-region Azure Queue Storage, consider the following important factors:

### Testing for region failures

### Alternative multi-region approaches

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Alternative multi-region approaches - reasons](includes/storage/reliability-storage-multi-region-alternative-reasons-include.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> For advanced multi-region requirements, consider using Azure Service Bus instead, which includes support for nonpaired regions.

[!INCLUDE [Storage - Alternative multi-region approaches - approach overview](includes/storage/reliability-storage-multi-region-alternative-approach-include.md)]

This approach requires you to manage message distribution, handle data synchronization between queues in the different storage accounts, and implement custom failover logic.

## Backups

Azure Queue Storage doesn't provide traditional backup capabilities like point-in-time restore, because queues are designed for transient message storage rather than long-term data persistence. Messages are typically processed and removed from queues during normal application operations.

For scenarios requiring message durability beyond the built-in redundancy options, consider implementing your own application-level message logging or persistence to a permanent data store, like Azure Blob Storage or Azure SQL Database. This approach allows you to maintain message history while using Queue Storage for its intended purpose of temporary message buffering and processing coordination.
