> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pinning to a single availability zone is only recommended when [cross-zone latency](./availability-zones-overview.md#inter-zone-latency) is too high for your needs and after you verify that the latency doesn't meet your requirements. By itself, a zonal resource doesn't provide resiliency to an availability zone outage. To improve the resiliency of a zonal resource, you need to explicitly deploy separate resources into multiple availability zones and configure traffic routing and failover.
