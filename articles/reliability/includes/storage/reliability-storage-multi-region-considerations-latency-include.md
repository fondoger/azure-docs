- **Asynchronous replication latency**: Data replication to the secondary region is asynchronous, which means there's a lag between when data is written to the primary region and when it becomes available in the secondary region. This lag can result in potential data loss (measured as Recovery Point Objective or RPO) if a primary region failure occurs before recent data is replicated. The replication lag is expected to be less than 15 minutes, but this is an estimate and not guaranteed.
