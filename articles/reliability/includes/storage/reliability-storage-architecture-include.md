[Locally redundant storage (LRS)](/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy?#locally-redundant-storage), the lowest-cost redundancy option, automatically stores and replicates three copies of your data within a single datacenter. Although LRS protects your data against server rack and drive failures, it doesn't account for disasters such as fire or flooding within a datacenter. In the face of such disasters, all replicas of a storage account configured to use LRS might be lost or unrecoverable.

Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) and geo-redundant storage (GRS/GZRS) provide additional protections, and are described in detail in this article.
