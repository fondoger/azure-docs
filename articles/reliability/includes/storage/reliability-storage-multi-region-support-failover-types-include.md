#### Failover types

Azure Storage supports three types of failover that are intended for different situations:

- **Customer-managed unplanned failover:** You are responsible for initiating recovery if there's a region-wide storage failure in your primary region.

- **Customer-managed planned failover:** You are responsible for initiating recovery if another part of your solution has a failure in your primary region, and you need to switch your whole solution over to a secondary region.

- **Microsoft-managed failover:** In exceptional situations, Microsoft might initiate failover for all GRS storage accounts in a region. However, Microsoft-managed failover is a last resort and is expected to only be performed after an extended period of outage. You shouldn't rely on Microsoft-managed failover.

Geo-redundant storage accounts can use any of these failover types. You don't need to preconfigure a storage account to use any of the failover types ahead of time.
