This section describes what to expect when a storage account is configured for geo-redundancy and all regions are operational.

- **Traffic routing between regions**: Azure Storage uses an active/passive approach where all write operations and most read operations are directed to the primary region.

  For RA-GRS and RA-GZRS configurations, applications can optionally read from the secondary region by accessing the secondary endpoint, but this requires explicit application configuration and is not automatic. Also, because of the asynchronous replication lag, data in the secondary region might be slightly outdated.

- **Data replication between regions**: Write operations are first committed to the primary region using the configured redundancy type (LRS for GRS/RA-GRS, or ZRS for GZRS/RA-GZRS). After successful completion in the primary region, data is asynchronously replicated to the secondary region where it's stored using locally redundant storage (LRS).
