- **Notification**: Microsoft doesn't automatically notify you when a zone is down. However:

    - You can use [Azure Resource Health](/azure/service-health/resource-health-overview) to monitor for the health of an individual resource. Set up [Resource Health alerts](/azure/service-health/resource-health-alert-arm-template-guide).
    - You can use [Azure Service Health](/azure/service-health/overview) to understand the overall health of the service, including any zone failures. Set up [Service Health alerts](/azure/service-health/resource-health-alert-arm-template-guide).
