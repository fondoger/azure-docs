This feature is useful if it's hard to redeploy your code, or if you store state on disk. For most solutions, you shouldn't rely exclusively on backups. Instead, use the other capabilities described in this guide to support your resiliency requirements. However, backups protect against some risks that other approaches don't. For more information, see [Back up and restore your app in App Service](/azure/app-service/manage-backup).
