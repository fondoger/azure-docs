To prepare for availability zone failure, consider *over-provisioning* the capacity of your App Service plan. Over-provisioning allows the solution to tolerate some degree of capacity loss and continue to function without degraded performance. For more information, see [Manage capacity with over-provisioning](/azure/reliability/concept-redundancy-replication-backup#manage-capacity-with-over-provisioning).
