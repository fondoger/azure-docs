An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources that run your web apps. All web apps must run inside an App Service plan. You can scale an App Service plan to run on multiple virtual machine *instances* (workers). These instances are the compute resources that run your app code. A single App Service plan can host multiple apps, all running on the same shared set of VM instances.
