App Service offers the following redundancy features:

- **Distribution across fault domains:** At the platform level - without any configuration from you - Azure automatically distributes your App Service planâ€™s VM instances across [fault domains](/azure/virtual-machines/availability-set-overview#fault-domains) within the Azure region. This distribution minimizes the risk of localized hardware failures by grouping virtual machines that share a common power source and network switch. 

- **Distribution across availability zones:** If you enable zone redundancy on a supported App Service plan, Azure also distributes your instances across availability zones within the region, offering higher resiliency in the event of a zone outage. To learn more about zone redundancy, see [Availability zone support](#availability-zone-support).

- **Scaling apps:** When you configure your App Service plan to run multiple VM instances, then all apps in the plan run on all instances by default. If you configure your plan for autoscaling, then all apps in the plan scale out together, based on the autoscale settings. However, you can customize how many plan instances run a specific app by using [per-app scaling](/azure/app-service/manage-scale-per-app).

- **Scale units:** Behind the scenes - without any configuration from you - Azure App Service runs on a platform infrastructure called *scale units* (also known as *stamps*). A scale unit includes all the components needed to host and run App Service, including compute, storage, networking, and load balancing. Azure manages scale units to ensure balanced workload distribution, perform routine maintenance, and maintain overall platform reliability.

    Certain capabilities might be applied to some scale units and not others. For example, zone redundancy might be supported by some App Service scale units but not by other scale units in the same region.
