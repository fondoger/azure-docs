# Publisher resource clean-up management
This article describes a new Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM) feature that detects unused publisher artifacts and automates  resource deletion. This feature helps to reduce the size of resource storage, lowering overall service costs. This feature also  improves security, by purging unnecessary resources in a timely manner, preventing further access or potential tampering.

## Publisher resource clean-up historic approach 
Prior to this feature, to clean-up AOSM publisher resources it's recommended to first execute an Azure Resource Graph (ARG) query to check for in-use references of target resources. For example, check to see if a Network Service Design Version (NSDV) is still used by a Site Network Services (SNS). If the ARG query responds with no references, then second, delete the target resource. 

## Publisher resource clean-up issues 
While most resource types support reference discovery via querying, before this feature artifact references in an artfact-store didn't, making safe artifact clean-up challenging. Other shortcomings addressed by this new feature include:
* NSDV and NFDV have only artifact-store references, making querying for discovery of artifact references impossible.
* Artifacts that are directly uploaded to artifact-store backing Azure Container Registry (ACR) don't build any references to the artifact-store.  
* Where helm charts reference artifacts in non-Azure ACRs, it's difficult to figure out current references current using queries. 

## Publisher resource clean-up expanded specification
With this new feature, AOSM supports background querying on artifacts to discover in-use references, and if none are found, artifacts are automatically marked for deletion. The artifacts, which include helm charts or images, are identified as unused during pre-flight command validation, ensuring they contain no references to any Network Function Design Version (NFDV) or NSDV. 

To support this capability, the resource type `artifact-manifest` is expanded to track cohesive grouping of artifacts. All images used by one nfApp version are kept in one `artifact manifest` version. A reference connection is built between the artifacts and the nfApp, which can now be checked during delete pre-flight validation.

Upon attemped deletion of an `artifact manifest`, if pre-flight validation passes, artifacts will be marked for deleteion and a success message will be returned. If pre-flight validation fails, the deletion request fails and no changes are made. An error message is emitted including reference to the first artifact found to be in-use along with what is still using it. THe following is an example of a failure message:

```azurecli
The resource '<artifactmanifest resourceId>' has some resources attached to it. The dependent resources are :"<NSDV/NFDV resource ids>"
```

## Artifact manifest resource type changes
In order to support the expanded `artifact-manifest` resource type specifications, changes are introduced to the resource provider API, starting with version `2025-03-30`. The following sections describe the behavior of AOSM before, and after, implementing this feature change. Migration to this new expanded resource type is optional and migration is discussed laster in this article.

### Artifact manifest uses strong correlation
The `artifact manifest` resource type has a strong correlation to helm artifacts (images and charts) uploaded into an artifact-store backing ACR. All artifacts used by a nfApp are kept in uniquely versioned artifact manifest instances. This builds reference connections between artifacts and nfApps. 

#### Before `2025-03-30` 
No strong correlation exists in the `artifact manifest` resource type.

```json
"artifacts": [ 
            { 
                "artifactName": "testapp", 
                "artifactType": "OCIArtifact", 
                "artifactVersion": "1.0.0" 
            }, 
            { 
                "artifactName": "nginx", 
                "artifactType": "OCIArtifact", 
                "artifactVersion": "1.0.0" 
            } 
```

#### From `2025-03-30`
The expanded `artifact manifest` resource type checks artifacts in `artifact manifest` path. No change in `artifact manifest` body. 

```json
"artifacts": [ 
            { 
                "artifactName": "testapp", 
                "artifactType": "OCIArtifact", 
                "artifactVersion": "1.0.0" 
            }, 
            { 
                "artifactName": "nginx", 
                "artifactType": "OCIArtifact", 
                "artifactVersion": "1.0.0" 
            } 
        ]
```

### Artifact manifest scope map token
The `artifact manifest` resource type creates scope map tokens with artifact name included in the path. 

#### Before `2025-03-30` 
No scope map tokens were created.

#### From `2025-03-30`
Scope map tokens are created at the same time as the `artifact manifest`.

### Artifact manifest upload path
All images that belong to an `artifact manifest` are uploaded using the `artifact manifest` name in the target path. For example, given ngnix included in `artifact manifest` 'cnfmanifest' needs to be uploaded using path 'cnfmanifest/ngnix'. 

#### Before `2025-03-30` 
No pathing requirements when uploading artifacts.

#### From `2025-03-30`
Pathing requirements enforced for artifacts in `artifact-manifest` resource type.

### Artifact manifest untag to delete
Deletion of an `artifact manifest` resource type untags all artifacts contained in that manifest version.

#### Before `2025-03-30` 
No changes made in the backing ACR for an artifact-store when deleting an `artifact manifest` resource type. 

#### From `2025-03-30`
Artifacts are untagged in the artifact-store backing ACR when deleting an `artifact manifest` resource type.

### Artifact manifest deletion conditions
The `artifact manifest` resource type can be deleted only if no referring resources are associated.

#### Before `2025-03-30` 
No condition prevented deletion of `artifact manifest` resource type.

#### From `2025-03-30`
For successful deletion, the `artifact manifest` must not contain any tagged resource references.

### Artifact manifest purge untagged
Purge untagged artifacts using Azure CLI command `az acr purge` given appropriate scheduling parameters.

#### Before `2025-03-30` 
No condition prevented purging of deleted artifacts.

#### From `2025-03-30`
The following Azure CLI command can be used to purge artifacts. The command can be scheduled via crontab or run on-demand.

```azurecli
az acr manifest list-metadata -n myRegistry â€“r myRepository --query "[?tags[0]==null].digest" -o tsv | %{ az acr repository delete -n myRegistry -image myRepository@$_ --yes }
```

### NDSV/NFDV updated artifact manifest reference
NSDV and NFDV include reference to `artifact manifest` resource type.

#### Before `2025-03-30` 
The NSDV and NFDV reference the artfact-store resource type.

```json
 "artifactStore": { 
    "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/testgroup/providers/Microsoft.HybridNetwork/publishers/testpublisher/artifactStores/as "
 }
```

#### From `2025-03-30`
The NSDV and NFDV reference the `artfact manifest` resource type.

```json
 "artifactStore": { 
    "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/testgroup/providers/Microsoft.HybridNetwork/publishers/testpublisher/artifactStores/as/artifactManifests/cnfmanifest"   } 
```

### NDSV/NFDV API version
The NSDV and NFDV referenced `artifact manifest` must be created with `2025-03-30` version or higher.

#### Before `2025-03-30` 
No such restriction.

#### From `2025-03-30`
The proper API version must be used to create the `artifact manifest` resource types.

## Artifact manifest migration steps
Complete the following task to migrate a deployed `artifact manifest` resource, created before API version '20025-03-30', to the new `artifact manifest` resource type, available after API version `2025-03-30`:
* Prepare platform by installing network function operator (NFO) extension version, at least 3.0.3131-220 or later.
* For existing resources created with older APIs, the NSDVs, NFDVs, and `artifact manifest` should be updated to newer API version.
  * First change the artifact store references to `artifact manifest` references.
  * Then update the `artifact manifests` with the expanded artifact references.
  * Finally upload the artifacts to the proper `artifact manifest` path. 
* The publisher clean-up action only supports resources created with API version `2025-03-30`
  * Resources created in older version can be updated to `2025-03-30` version.
  * Only artifacts uploaded after the upgrade are considered for clean-up.
  * Artifacts uploaded before the upgrade aren't considered for clean-up

> [!NOTE]
> Resources created with NSDV and NFDV, which still have reference to artifact stores instead of artifact manifests, can't be used to find out decommissioned artifacts unless they're upgraded.
