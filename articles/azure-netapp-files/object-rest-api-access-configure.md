# Configure object REST API access in Azure NetApp Files (preview)

Azure NetApp Files supports access to S3 objects with the [object REST API](object-rest-api-introduction.md) feature. With the object REST API feature, you can connect to services including Azure AI Search, Azure AI Foundry, Azure Databricks, OneLake, and others.

## Considerations

* Editing a bucket isn't currently supported. If you need to edit a bucket, you should instead create a new bucket with the same name as the one you want to edit then adjust the properties. 

## Register the feature 

The object REST API feature in Azure NetApp Files is currently in preview. You must submit a [waitlist request](https://forms.office.com/r/pTpTESUSZb) to use the object REST API feature. Activation takes approximately one week. An email notification is sent to confirm your enrollment in the preview. 

## Create the self-signed certificate

You must generate a PEM-formatted SSL certificate. You can create the SSL certificate in the Azure portal or with a script.  

<!-- DNS? -->

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

See the [Azure Key Vault documentation for adding a certificate to Key Vault](/azure//key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal#add-a-certificate-to-key-vault). 

When creating the certificate, ensure:

* the **Content Type** is set to PEM
* the **Subject** field is set to the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Azure NetApp Files endpoint using the format `"CN=<IP or FQDN>"`
* the **DNS Names** entry specifies the IP address or FQDN

### [Script](#tab/script)

This script creates a certificate locally. Set the computer name `CN=` to the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your object REST API-enabled endpoint. This script creates a folder that includes the necessary PEM file and private keys. 

Create and run the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Define certificate details 
CERT_DAYS=365 
RSA_STR_LEN=2048 
CERT_DIR="./certs" 
KEY_DIR="./certs/private" 
CN="mylocalsite.local" 

# Create directories if they don't exist 
mkdir -p $CERT_DIR 
mkdir -p $KEY_DIR 

# Generate private key 
openssl genrsa -out $KEY_DIR/server-key.pem $RSA_STR_LEN 

# Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR) 
openssl req -new -key $KEY_DIR/server-key.pem -out $CERT_DIR/server-req.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/OU=Unit/CN=$CN" 

# Generate self-signed certificate 
openssl x509 -req -days $CERT_DAYS -in $CERT_DIR/server-req.pem -signkey $KEY_DIR/server-key.pem -out $CERT_DIR/server-cert.pem 

echo "Self-signed certificate created at $CERT_DIR/server-cert.pem"
```

## Create a bucket

To enable object REST API, you must create a bucket. 

1. From your NetApp volume, select **Buckets**. 
1. To create a bucket, select **+Create**. 
1. Provide the following information for the bucket:
    * **Name**

        Specify the name for your bucket. Refer to [Naming rules and restrictions for Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules.md#microsoftnetapp) for naming conventions.
    * **Path**

        The subdirectory path for object REST API access. For full volume access, leave this field blank or use `/` for the root directory.
    * **User ID (UID)**

        The UID used to read the bucket.

    * **Group ID (GID)**

        The GID used to read the bucket.

    * **Permissions**

        Select Read or Read-Write. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/object-rest-api-access-configure/create-bucket.png" alt-text="Screenshot of create a bucket menu." lightbox="./media/object-rest-api-access-configure/create-bucket.png":::

1. If you haven't provided a certificate, upload your PEM file. 

    To upload a certificate, provide the following information:

    * **Fully qualified domain name**

        Enter the fully qualified domain name. 

    * **Certificate source**

        Upload the appropriate certificate. Only PEM files are supported. 

    Select **Save**. 

1. Select **Create**. 

After you create a bucket, you need to generate credentials to access the bucket.

## Generate credentials

1. Navigate to your newly created bucket. Select **Generate keys**.
1. Enter the desired Access key lifespan in days then select **Generate keys**. After you select **Generate keys**, the portal displays the access key and secret access key. 
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >The access key and secret access key are only displayed once. Store the keys securely. Do not share the keys.
1. After you set the credentials, you can generate a new access key and secret access key by selecting the `...` menu then selecting **Generate access keys**. Generating new keys immediately invalidates the existing keys. 

## Delete a bucket

Deleting a bucket is a permanent operation. You can't recover the bucket after deleting it. 

1. In your NetApp account, navigate to **Buckets**. 
1. Select the checkbox next to the bucket you want to delete. 
1. Select **Delete**. 
1. In the modal, select **Delete** to confirm you want to delete the bucket.
