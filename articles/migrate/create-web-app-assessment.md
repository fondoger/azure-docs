# Tutorial: Create web app assessment for modernization 

This article describes how to create a web app assessment for modernization to [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) or [Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/overview) using Azure Migrate. Creating an assessment for your web apps provides the recommended targets for them and key insights such as app-readiness, target right-sizing, and cost to host, and run these apps month over month. 

In this article, you'll learn how to: 

- Set up your Azure Migrate environment to assess web apps. 
- Choose a set of related web applications discovered using the Azure Migrate appliance. 
- Provide assessment configurations such as preferred Azure targets, target region, Azure reserved Instances, sizing criteria and more. 
- Create web app assessment with a recommended modernization path. 

## Prerequisites 

- Deploy and configure the Azure Migrate appliance in your [VMware](tutorial-discover-vmware.md), [Hyper-V](tutorial-discover-hyper-v.md), or [physical](tutorial-discover-physical.md) environments. 
- Check the [appliance requirements](migrate-appliance.md#appliance---vmware) and [URL access](migrate-appliance.md#url-access) to be provided. 
- Follow [these steps](how-to-discover-sql-existing-project.md) to discover web apps running on your environment. Web app assessment is supported for appliance-based discovery only.

## Create a workload assessment for web apps

To create an assessment, follow these steps:

1. On the Azure Migrate project **Overview** page, under **Decide and Plan**, select **Assessments**.

## Target right-sizing for Web apps

Azure Migrate supports two types of target sizing for Web app assessments:

#### Performance-based Sizing

This method provides target size recommendations based on gathered performance data. 

- For ASP.NET web apps, performance data is collected for the associated application pools.
    - When multiple web apps run under the same application pool, the percentage of resources allocated to every web app is a linear function of the number of apps in the application pool.
    - The more the number of web apps in a single application pool, the lesser the resource allocation per app.
    - The minimum utilization share for any web app is 60%.

- For Java Web Apps on Tomcat Server, performance data is collected for each Tomcat server instance. When multiple web apps are running on a single Tomcat server, resource distribution follows a similar pattern as with ASP.NET web apps.

- Performance data is collected every 15 minutes in both ASP.NET and Java web app scenarios and stored in a service-managed storage account.

> [!NOTE]
> For private endpoint scenarios, data is stored in a user-managed Storage account set up during Azure Migrate project creation.

#### As on-premises sizing: 
This method provides target size recommendations based on configuration data. Following values are considered for CPU and memory utilization per web app:
- ASP.NET web app: 0.15 cores, 0.25 GB memory
- Java web app: 0.15 cores, 0.15 GB memory. If static memory is configured for Tomcat server, it is considered instead of these values.

Besides the values estimated for performance-based and as on-premises sizing, following default resource utilization values for running the container image for each web app are added when Azure App Service containers and AKS are considered as migration targets:
- ASP.NET web app: 0.2 core, 0.65 GB memory
- Java web app: 0.1 core, 0.25 GB memory
