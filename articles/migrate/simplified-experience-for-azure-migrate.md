# Overview of simplified experience for Azure Migrate (agent-based migration of VMware or physical servers)

The simplified experience leverages an enhanced agent-based migration stack tailored for physical and VMware environments, offering several key advantages:
- **Broader OS support**: It enables migration of newer Linux distributions to Azure, expanding compatibility and allowing customers to benefit from the latest innovations in Linux technology.
- **Modern replication appliance**: It utilizes Windows Server 2022 (WS2022) for the replication appliance, ensuring robust and up-to-date infrastructure.
- **Unified OS support matrix**: This provides a consistent and streamlined approach to operating system support across migration workflows, simplifying planning and execution.
  
Overall, the upgraded stack equips customers with powerful tools to efficiently migrate newer Linux distributions, leverage modern Windows Server platform for replication, and benefit from a unified OS support framework, enhancing the entire migration journey to Azure.

## Key differences between classic and simplified experience

The key differences between the Classic and Simplified experience:

| **Aspect** | **Classic experience** | **Simplified experience** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Upgrade and replacement | Old version with traditional interface | Upgraded version offering a more streamlined and user-friendly interface
| Enhanced support matrix | Limited support for newer Linux distributions | Supports newer Linux distributions and uses Windows Server 2022 as the replication appliance|
| Easier Onboarding| Extensive steps and inputs for onboarding and setup | Onboard workloads with 50% fewer configuration steps|
| Automatic updates| Perform manual upgrades for both the mobility agent and configuration server components| Automatic upgrades are available for both mobility agent and replication appliance|
| Improved performance and reliability | Standard performance and reliability | Leveraging latest technologies for better performance and reliability in physical and VMware agent-based migrations. |
|Streamlined migration process| Traditional migration process	 | Provides a more seamless and efficient migration process, addressing multiple customer concerns. |
| Retirement of classic experience | Azure Migrate supports existing replication and migrations until 30 September 2026. Plan your final migrations for these machines well before the retirement date |Switch sooner to gain the richer benefits of a simplified experience|

## Retirement of classic experience
**Action required**
- The classic experience retires on **30 September 2026**. Azure Migrate supports your existing replications and migrations on classic experience until that date. Switch sooner to gain the richer benefits of a simplified experience.
- You can continue using the classic experience for existing VMware and physical machines until **30 September 2026**. Plan your final migrations for these machines before the retirement date. After September 2026, you must move to the new simplified experience to continue replications and trigger migrations.
- You wonâ€™t be able to view, manage, or perform replication & migration related operations on these machines through the Azure portal after this retirement date.
- New features, security updates, enhancements, and mobility agent support for additional Linux distributions are available only in the simplified experience.
