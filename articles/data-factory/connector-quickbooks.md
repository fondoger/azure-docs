# Copy data from QuickBooks Online by using Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article outlines how to use the copy activity in an Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from QuickBooks Online. It builds on the [overview article about the copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md).

This article also describes how to upgrade the QuickBooks connector from version 1.0 to 2.0. Version 2.0 provides improved native QuickBooks support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The QuickBooks connector version 1.0 is at [removal stage](connector-release-stages-and-timelines.md). You are recommended to [upgrade the QuickBooks connector](#quickbooks-connector-lifecycle-and-upgrade) from version 1.0 to 2.0.

## Supported capabilities

The QuickBooks connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |

                "useEncryptedEndpoints": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Handling refresh tokens for the linked service

When you use the QuickBooks Online connector in a linked service, it's important to manage OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens from QuickBooks correctly.

The linked service uses a refresh token to obtain new access tokens. However, QuickBooks Online periodically updates the refresh token. This action invalidates the previous token.

The linked service doesn't automatically update the refresh token in Azure Key Vault, so you need to manage updating the refresh token to ensure uninterrupted connectivity. Otherwise, you might encounter authentication failures after the refresh token expires.

You can manually update the refresh token in Azure Key Vault based on the QuickBooks Online policy for expiry of refresh tokens. Another approach is to automate updates by using a scheduled task or an [Azure function](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-keyvault-secret-rotation-handling) that checks for a new refresh token and updates it in Azure Key Vault.

## Dataset properties

For a full list of available sections and properties for defining datasets, see [Datasets in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md).

To copy data from QuickBooks Online, set the `type` property of the dataset to `QuickBooksObject`. The QuickBooks dataset supports the following properties:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| `type` | The type of the dataset. It must be set to `QuickBooksObject`. | Yes |
| `tableName` | Name of the table. | No (if `query` in the activity source is specified) |

Here's an example:

```json
{
    "name": "QuickBooksDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "QuickBooksObject",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<QuickBooks linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see [Pipelines and activities in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics](concepts-pipelines-activities.md). This section provides a list of properties that the QuickBooks source supports.

### QuickBooks as source

To copy data from QuickBooks Online, set the source type in the copy activity to `QuickBooksSource`. The QuickBooks dataset supports the following properties in the copy activity's `source` section:

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| `type` | The type of the copy activity source. It must be set to `QuickBooksSource`. | Yes |
| `query` | Use the custom SQL query to read data. <br><br>For version 2.0 of the QuickBooks connector, you can use only the QuickBooks native query, with limitations. For more information, see [Query operations and syntax](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/learn/explore-the-quickbooks-online-api/data-queries) on the Intuit Developer site. The `tableName` value specified in the query must match the `tableName` value in the dataset. <br><br>For version 1.0 of the QuickBooks connector, you can use the SQL-92 query. For example: `"SELECT * FROM "Bill" WHERE Id = '123'"`. | No (if `tableName` in the dataset is specified) |

Here's an example:

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromQuickBooks",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<QuickBooks input dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "outputs": [
            {
                "referenceName": "<output dataset name>",
                "type": "DatasetReference"
            }
        ],
        "typeProperties": {
            "source": {
                "type": "QuickBooksSource",
                "query": "SELECT * FROM \"Bill\" WHERE Id = '123' "
            },
            "sink": {
                "type": "<sink type>"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

For a full list of available sections and properties for defining activities, see [Pipelines and activities in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics](concepts-pipelines-activities.md).

## Copy data from QuickBooks Desktop

The copy activity in the service can't copy data directly from QuickBooks Desktop. To copy data from QuickBooks Desktop, export your QuickBooks data to a comma-separated values (CSV) file and then upload the file to Azure Blob Storage. From there, you can use the service to copy the data to the sink of your choice.

## Data type mapping for Quickbooks

When you copy data from QuickBooks, the following mappings apply from the QuickBooks data types to the internal data types that the service uses. To learn about how the copy activity maps the source schema and data type to the sink, see [Schema and data type mapping in copy activity](copy-activity-schema-and-type-mapping.md).

| QuickBooks data type | Interim service data type (for version 2.0) | Interim service data type (for version 1.0) |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| `String`| `string`| `string` |
| `Boolean` | `bool` | `bool` |
| `DateTime` | `datetime` | `datetime` |
| `Decimal` | `decimal (15,2)`  | `decimal (15, 2)` |
| `Enum` | `string` | `string` |
| `Date` | `datetime` | `datetime` |
| `BigDecimal` | `decimal (15,2)` | `decimal (15, 2)` |
| `Integer` | `int` | `int` |

## Lookup activity properties

For details about the properties of the lookup activity, see [Lookup activity in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics](control-flow-lookup-activity.md).

## Quickbooks connector lifecycle and upgrade

The following table summarizes information about the versions of the QuickBooks connector:

| Version  | Release stage | Change log |  
| :----------- | :------- |:------- |
| 1.0 | Removed | Not applicable. |  
| 2.0 | General availability |QuickBooks native query is supported, with limitations. `GROUP BY` clauses, `JOIN` clauses, and aggregate functions (`Avg`, `Max`, `Sum`) aren't supported. For more information, see [Query operations and syntax](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/learn/explore-the-quickbooks-online-api/data-queries) on the Intuit Developer site. <br><br>The `tableName` value specified in the query must match the `tableName` value in the dataset. <br><br>The SQL-92 query is not supported. <br><br>The `useEncryptedEndpoints` property is not supported.  |

### Upgrade the Quickbooks connector from version 1.0 to version 2.0

1. In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse workspace.

1. Go to the **Manage** tab, select **Linked services**, and then select **Edit** for the linked service.

1. On the **Edit linked service** pane, select **2.0** for the version. For more information, see the [linked service properties for version 2.0](#version-20) earlier in this article.

1. If you use a SQL query in the copy activity source or the lookup activity that refers to the version 1.0 linked service, you need to convert it to the QuickBooks native query. Learn more about the native query from [Copy activity properties](#copy-activity-properties) earlier in this article and from [Query operations and syntax](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/learn/explore-the-quickbooks-online-api/data-queries) on the Intuit Developer site.
