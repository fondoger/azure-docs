# Control OPC UA servers

_OPC UA servers_ are software applications that communicate with assets. OPC UA servers expose _OPC UA tags_ that represent tags. You can write values to some tags to control the behavior of your OPC UA server and physical assets.

This article describes:

- The different ways you can write data to your OPC UA server.
- How to find the sample application that demonstrates these scenarios.

## How to write data to an OPC UA server

The `opc-ua-commander` service in the Azure IoT Operations cluster connects to your OPC UA server and performs write operations on your behalf. The `opc-ua-commander` service uses the [RPC protocol](https://github.com/Azure/iot-operations-sdks/blob/main/doc/reference/rpc-protocol.md) over MQTT to receive write requests and send responses. The message must include the required system and user [message metadata](https://github.com/Azure/iot-operations-sdks/blob/main/doc/reference/message-metadata.md).

The commander service can perform the following types of write operations:

### Simple write using a dataset

The boiler asset in the OPC PLC simulator has a tag called `TargetTemperature` that you can write to in order to set the target temperature of the boiler. Create a namespace asset that includes a dataset with a data point that maps to this tag:

| Name | Data source                                |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| `TargetTemperature` | `nsu=http://microsoft.com/Opc/OpcPlc/Boiler;i=6217` |

When you publish a message to the topic `azure-iot-operations/asset-operations/<asset name>/builtin/<dataset name>` that includes a value for `TargetTemperature`, the commander service writes the value to the OPC UA server. For example, to set the target temperature to 176, publish a message with the following payload to the topic `azure-iot-operations/asset-operations/<asset name>/builtin/<dataset name>`:

```json
{
    "TargetTemperature": 176
}
```

The message must include the required [metadata](https://github.com/Azure/iot-operations-sdks/blob/main/doc/reference/message-metadata.md).

### Complex write using a dataset

The boiler asset in the OPC PLC simulator has a tag called `BoilerStatus` that you can write to in order to set the status of the boiler. Create a namespace asset that includes a dataset with a data point that maps to this tag:

| Name | Data source                                |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| `BoilerStatus` | `nsu=http://microsoft.com/Opc/OpcPlc/Boiler;i=15013` |

When you publish a message to the topic `azure-iot-operations/asset-operations/<asset name>/builtin/<dataset name>` that includes a value for `BoilerStatus`, the commander service writes the values to the OPC UA server. For example, to set the boiler status, publish a message with the following payload to the topic `azure-iot-operations/asset-operations/<asset name>/builtin/<dataset name>`:

```json
{
    "BoilerStatus": {
        "Temperature": {
            "Top": 123,
            "Bottom": 456
        },
        "Pressure": 789,
        "HeaterState": "Off_0"
    }
}
```

The message must include the required [metadata](https://github.com/Azure/iot-operations-sdks/blob/main/doc/reference/message-metadata.md).

### Call a method using a management group

The boiler asset in the OPC PLC simulator has an action called `Switch` that you can call to switch the boiler on or off. Create a namespace asset that includes a management group with an action that maps to this action:

| name | targetUri  | actionType | typeRef |
|------|------------|------------|---------|
| `Switch` | `nsu=http://microsoft.com/Opc/OpcPlc/Boiler;i=5017` | `Call` | `nsu=http://microsoft.com/Opc/OpcPlc/Boiler;i=5019` |

An action always has the following properties:

- `name`: Name of the action in a `ManagementGroup`.
- `targetUri`: Maps to the `methodId` in [OPC UA](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/Core/Part4/v104/docs/5.11.2.2). References the method to be called.
- `actionType`: The type of action. For methods, this is always `Call`.
- `typeRef`: Maps to the `objectId` in [OPC UA](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/Core/Part4/v104/docs/5.11.2.2). Distinguishes methods defined for multiple objects.

When you publish a message to the topic `azure-iot-operations/asset-operations/<asset name>/<management group name>/<action name>` that includes a value for `Switch`, the commander service calls the method in the OPC UA server. For example, to switch the boiler on, publish a message with the following payload to the topic `azure-iot-operations/asset-operations/<asset name>/<dataset name>/<management group name>/<action name>`:

```json
{
  "On": true
}
```

> [!TIP]
> To call a method without parameters, set the payload to `{}`.

The message must include the required [metadata](https://github.com/Azure/iot-operations-sdks/blob/main/doc/reference/message-metadata.md).

### Explicit write using a management group

Use explicit writes to write to data points that aren't part of a dataset. As compared to a dataset write, the differences are:

- The data points must be explicitly configured.
- Value changes aren't transmitted as part of the telemetry. Therefore, the client must rely on the MQTT RPC response.

 Create a namespace asset that includes a management group with an action defined as follows:

| name | targetUri  | actionType |
|------|------------|------------|
| `simple-write` | `nsu=http://microsoft.com/Opc/OpcPlc/Boiler;i=6217` | `Write` |

An action always has the following properties:

- `name`: Name of the action in a `ManagementGroup`.
- `targetUri`: The `nodeId` of the node to write to.
- `actionType`: The type of action. For explicit writes, this is always `Write`.

When you publish a message to the topic `azure-iot-operations/asset-operations/<asset name>/<management group name>/<action name>` that includes a value for `simple-write`, the commander service writes to the target URI. For example, to set the target temperature for the boiler, publish a message with the following payload to the topic `azure-iot-operations/asset-operations/<asset name>/<dataset name>/<management group name>/<action name>`:

```json
{
  "TargetTemperature": 95
}
```

The message must include the required [metadata](https://github.com/Azure/iot-operations-sdks/blob/main/doc/reference/message-metadata.md).

### Endpoint operations

Endpoint operations are process control calls that work on an inbound endpoint only and don't need a namespace asset.

For example, to dump the address space of an OPC UA server, send a message to the topic `azure-iot-operations/endpoint-operations/{InboundEndpointName}/browse`.

If the payload contains an empty JSON object the entire address space is returned.

If you use a JSON object like:

```json
{
    "root_data_point": "<OPC UA Expanded Node ID>",
    "depth": 128
}
```

`root_data_point` defines the starting point for the browse operation and `depth` defines how deep the browse operation should go.


## Sample application

The [sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/explore-iot-operations/tree/main/samples/process-control) shows you how to control the simulated boiler asset by setting values on the OPC UA server.

The sample application uses the [protocol compiler](https://github.com/Azure/iot-operations-sdks/blob/main/codegen/README.md) in the SDK to generate the required C# to implement the RPC protocol code from a [Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL) V3](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v3/DTDL.Specification.v3.md) model.

For example, the DTDL model for the `call` actions the sample uses looks like this:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "dtmi:dtdl:context;4",
    "dtmi:dtdl:extension:mqtt;2",
    "dtmi:dtdl:extension:requirement;1"
  ],
  "@id": "dtmi:opcua:write;1",
  "@type": ["Interface", "Mqtt"],
  "payloadFormat": "custom/0",
  "commandTopic": "{ex:namespace}/asset-operations/{ex:asset}/builtin/{ex:dataset}",
  "schemas": [],
  "contents": [
    {
      "@type": "Command",
      "name": "WriteDataset",
      "request": {
        "name": "WriteDatasetRequest",
        "schema": "bytes"
      },
      "response": {
        "name": "WriteDatasetResponse",
        "schema": "bytes"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
