# Azure IoT Operations versions, support, and licensing

This article explains the supported versions, environments, and regions for Azure IoT Operations, along with its key dependencies and related resources. Use this guide to ensure compatibility and optimize your deployment. The guide also provides information about licensing for Azure IoT Operations.

## Supported versions

[!INCLUDE [supported-versions](includes/supported-versions.md)]

## Supported environments

[!INCLUDE [supported-environments-table](includes/supported-environments-table.md)]

## Supported regions

Azure IoT Operations supports Arc-enabled clusters in these regions:

| Region       | CLI value   |
|--------------|-------------|
| East US      | eastus      |
| East US 2    | eastus2     |
| West US      | westus      |
| West US 2    | westus2     |
| West US 3    | westus3     |
| West Europe  | westeurope  |
| North Europe | northeurope |
| Germany West Central | germanywestcentral |

This list applies only to the region you use to connect your cluster to Azure Arc. It doesn't limit you from using your preferred Azure region for cloud resources. Azure IoT Operations components and other resources deployed to clusters in these regions connect to cloud resources in different regions.

## Dependencies

Azure IoT Operations depends on these support services and features:

* [Azure Device Registry](./discover-manage-assets/overview-manage-assets.md#azure-device-registry)
* [Schema registry](./connect-to-cloud/concept-schema-registry.md)
* [Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/container-storage/overview)
* [Azure Key Vault Secret Store extension](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/secret-store-extension)
* [Azure Monitor pipeline](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/edge-pipeline-configure)
* Workload identity federation in Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes

> [!NOTE]
> These features and services, used as dependencies by internal Azure IoT Operations systems, inherit general availability status from the Azure IoT Operations product license.

> [!NOTE]
> For the *Azure Device Registry* and *Schema registry* capabilities, Azure IoT Operations is the only product under which these  services are licensed for production use.

## Licensing

Azure IoT Operations licensing is covered by the terms stated in the [Microsoft Online Service Agreement (MOSA)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/MicrosoftAzure/MOSA). Licensing that's specific to Azure IoT Operations can be found in the *Service Specific Terms* section of the MOSA.

If any of the licensing terms found in these documents block your adoption of Azure IoT Operations in trial, non-production, or production scenarios, contact [azureiotoperationslicensinghelp@microsoft.com](mailto:azureiotoperationslicensinghelp@microsoft.com). Depending on your specific circumstances, there might be solutions to unblock your project.
