# Exchange X12 messages in B2B workflows using Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-consumption-standard.md)]

To send and receive X12 messages in workflows that you create using Azure Logic Apps, use the *X12* connector. This connector provides operations that support and manage X12 communication.

This guide shows how to add the encoding and decoding actions for X12 to an existing logic app workflow. The X12 connector doesn't provide any triggers, so you can use any trigger to start your workflow. The examples in this guide use the [Request trigger](../connectors/connectors-native-reqres.md).

## Connector technical reference

The X12 connector has different versions, based on [logic app type and host environment](logic-apps-overview.md#resource-environment-differences).

| Logic app | Environment | Connector version |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Consumption** | Multitenant Azure Logic Apps | X12 managed connector, which appears in the connector gallery under **Shared**. The X12 connector has one trigger and multiple actions. You can use any trigger that works for your scenario. For more information, see: <br><br>- [X12 managed connector reference](/connectors/x12/) <br>- [X12 message limits](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#b2b-protocol-limits) |
| **Standard** | Single-tenant Azure Logic Apps, App Service Environment v3 (Windows plans only), and hybrid deployment | X12 built-in connector, which appears in the connector gallery under **Built-in**, and X12 managed connector, which appears in the connector gallery under **Shared**. The X12 managed connector has one trigger and multiple actions. The X12 built-in connector provides only actions. You can use any trigger that works for your scenario. <br><br>The built-in version differs in the following ways: <br><br>- The built-in version can directly access Azure virtual networks. You don't need an on-premises data gateway. <br><br>- The built-in version provides higher throughput and lower latency. <br><br>For more information, see: <br><br>- [X12 managed connector reference](/connectors/x12/) <br>- [X12 built-in connector operations](#x12-operations) <br>- [X12 message limits](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#b2b-protocol-limits) |



## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription yet, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

- The logic app resource and workflow where you want to use the X12 operations.

  For more information, see:

  - [Create a Consumption logic app workflow in Azure Logic Apps](quickstart-create-example-consumption-workflow.md)
  - [Create a Standard logic app workflow in Azure Logic Apps](create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal.md)

- An [integration account resource](./enterprise-integration/create-integration-account.md) to define and store artifacts for use in enterprise integration and B2B workflows.

  - Both your integration account and logic app resource must exist in the same Azure subscription and Azure region.

  - Defines at least two [trading partners](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md) that participate in the **X12** operation used in your workflow. The definitions for both partners must use the same X12 *business identity* qualifier.

  - Defines an [X12 agreement](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-agreements.md) between the trading partners that participate in your workflow. Each agreement requires a host partner and a guest partner. The content in the messages between you and the other partner must match the agreement type. For information about agreement settings to use when receiving and sending messages, see [X12 message settings](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12-message-settings.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > If you're working with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) schemas, you must add a `schemaReferences` section to your agreement. For more information, see [HIPAA schemas and message types](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12-message-settings.md#hipaa-schemas).

  - Defines the [schemas](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md) to use for XML validation.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > If you're working with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) schemas, make sure to review [HIPAA schemas and message types](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12-message-settings.md#hipaa-schemas).

- Before you start working with X12 operations, you must [link your Consumption logic app](enterprise-integration/create-integration-account.md?tabs=consumption#link-account) or [link your Standard logic app](enterprise-integration/create-integration-account.md?tabs=standard#link-account) to an integration account.

  When you add an X12 operation, you must also create a connection to the integration account. You can create the connection when you add the X12 operation to your workflow.

## Encode X12 messages

The *Encode to X12 message* operation performs the following tasks:

- Resolves the agreement by matching sender and receiver context properties.

- Serializes the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and converts XML-encoded messages into EDI transaction sets in the interchange.

- Applies transaction set header and trailer segments.

- Generates an interchange control number, a group control number, and a transaction set control number for each outgoing interchange.

- Replaces separators in the payload data.

- Validates EDI and partner-specific properties.

  - Schema validation of transaction-set data elements against the message schema.
  - EDI validation on transaction-set data elements.
  - Extended validation on transaction-set data elements.

- Requests a Technical and Functional Acknowledgment, if configured.

  - Generates a Technical Acknowledgment as a result of header validation. The technical acknowledgment reports the status of the processing of an interchange header and trailer by the address receiver.
  - Generates a Functional Acknowledgment as a result of body validation. The functional acknowledgment reports each error encountered while processing the received document.

To encode messages with the X12 connector, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app resource and workflow in the designer.

1. In the designer, follow these [general steps](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=standard#add-action) to add the X12 action named **Encode to X12 message by agreement name** to your workflow.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > To use the **Encode to X12 message by identities** action instead, you must later provide different parameter values, such as the **Sender identifier** and **Receiver identifier** that's specified by your X12 agreement. You must also specify the **XML message to encode** value, which you can select as the output from the trigger or a preceding action.

1. When you're prompted to create a connection to your integration account, provide the following information:

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------------|
   | **Connection Name** | Yes | A name for the connection. |
   | **Integration Account ID** | Yes | The resource ID for your integration account, which has the following format: <br><br>**`/subscriptions/<Azure-subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Logic/integrationAccounts/<integration-account-name>`** <br><br>For example: <br>`/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/integrationAccount-RG/providers/Microsoft.Logic/integrationAccounts/myIntegrationAccount` <br><br>To find this resource ID, follow these steps:  <br><br>1. In the Azure portal, open your integration account. <br>2. On the integration account sidebar, select **Overview**. <br>3. On the **Overview** page, select **JSON View**. <br>4. From the **Resource ID** property, copy the value. |
   | **Integration Account SAS URL** | Yes | The request endpoint URL that uses shared access signature (SAS) authentication to provide access to your integration account. This callback URL has the following format: <br><br>**`https://<request-endpoint-URI>sp=<permissions>sv=<SAS-version>sig=<signature>`** <br><br>For example: <br>`https://prod-04.west-us.logic-azure.com:443/integrationAccounts/aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb?api-version=2015-08-1-preview&sp=XXXXXXXXX&sv=1.0&sig=aB1cD2eF-3gH4iJ5kL6-mN7oP8qR` <br><br>To find this URL, follow these steps: <br><br>1. In the Azure portal, open your integration account. <br>2. On the integration account sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Callback URL**. <br>3. From the **Generated Callback URL** property, copy the value. |
   | **Size of Control Number Block** | No | The block size of control numbers to reserve from an agreement for high throughput scenarios. |

   For example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/create-encode-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Azure portal, workflow with action named Encode to X12 message by agreement name, and action connection information." lightbox="./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/create-encode-connection.png":::
   
1. When you're done, select **Create new**.

1. In the X12 action information pane, provide the following values:

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------------|
   | **Name of X12 agreement** | Yes | The X12 agreement to use. |
   | **XML message to encode** | Yes | The XML message to encode. |

## Decode X12 messages

The **Decode X12 message** operation performs the following tasks:

- Validates the envelope against trading partner agreement.

- Validates EDI and partner-specific properties.

  - EDI structural validation and extended schema validation
  - Interchange envelope structural validation
  - Schema validation of the envelope against the control schema
  - Schema validation of the transaction set data elements against the message schema
  - EDI validation on transaction-set data elements

- Verifies that the interchange, group, and transaction set control numbers aren't duplicates.

  - Checks the interchange control number against previously received interchanges.
  - Checks the group control number against other group control numbers in the interchange.
  - Checks the transaction set control number against other transaction set control numbers in that group.

- Splits an interchange into transaction sets, or preserves the entire interchange:

  - Split the interchange into transaction sets or suspend transaction sets on error: Parse each transaction set. The X12 decode action outputs only the transaction sets that fail validation to `badMessages`, and outputs the remaining transactions sets to `goodMessages`.

  - Split the interchange into transaction sets or suspend interchange on error: Parse each transaction set. If one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation, the X12 decode action outputs all the transaction sets in that interchange to `badMessages`.

  - Preserve the interchange or suspend transaction sets on error: Preserve the interchange and process the entire batched interchange. The X12 decode action outputs only the transaction sets that fail validation to `badMessages`, and outputs the remaining transactions sets to `goodMessages`.

  - Preserve the interchange or suspend interchange on error: Preserve the interchange and process the entire batched interchange. If one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation, the X12 decode action outputs all the transaction sets in that interchange to `badMessages`.

- Generates a Technical and Functional Acknowledgment, if configured.

  - Generates a Technical Acknowledgment as a result of header validation. The technical acknowledgment reports the status of the processing of an interchange header and trailer by the address receiver.
  - Generates a Functional Acknowledgment as a result of body validation. The functional acknowledgment reports each error encountered while processing the received document.

To decode X12 messages in your workflow with the X12 connector, follow these steps: 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your logic app resource and workflow in the designer.

1. In the designer, follow these [general steps](create-workflow-with-trigger-or-action.md?tabs=standard#add-action) to add the X12 action named **Decode X12 message** to your workflow.

1. When you're prompted to create a connection to your integration account, provide the following information:

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------------|
   | **Connection Name** | Yes | A name for the connection. |
   | **Integration Account ID** | Yes | The resource ID for your integration account, which has the following format: <br><br>**`/subscriptions/<Azure-subscription-ID>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Logic/integrationAccounts/<integration-account-name>`** <br><br>For example: <br>`/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/integrationAccount-RG/providers/Microsoft.Logic/integrationAccounts/myIntegrationAccount` <br><br>To find this resource ID, follow these steps:  <br><br>1. In the Azure portal, open your integration account. <br>2. On the integration account sidebar, select **Overview**. <br>3. On the **Overview** page, select **JSON View**. <br>4. From the **Resource ID** property, copy the value. |
   | **Integration Account SAS URL** | Yes | The request endpoint URL that uses shared access signature (SAS) authentication to provide access to your integration account. This callback URL has the following format: <br><br>**`https://<request-endpoint-URI>sp=<permissions>sv=<SAS-version>sig=<signature>`** <br><br>For example: <br>`https://prod-04.west-us.logic-azure.com:443/integrationAccounts/aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb?api-version=2015-08-1-preview&sp=XXXXXXXXX&sv=1.0&sig=aB1cD2eF-3gH4iJ5kL6-mN7oP8qR` <br><br>To find this URL, follow these steps: <br><br>1. In the Azure portal, open your integration account. <br>2. On the integration account sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Callback URL**. <br>3. From the **Generated Callback URL** property, copy the value. |
   | **Size of Control Number Block** | No | The block size of control numbers to reserve from an agreement for high throughput scenarios. |

   For example:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/create-decode-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Azure portal, workflow with action named Decode X12 message, and action connection information." lightbox="./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/create-decode-connection.png":::

1. When you're done, select **Create new**.

1. In the X12 action information box, provide the following values:

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |-----------|----------|-------------|
   | **X12 flat file message to decode** | Yes | The X12 message in flat file format to decode <br><br>**Note**: The XML message payload or content in a message array is base64 encoded. You must use an expression that processes this content. For example, the following expression processes the content in a message array as XML using the `xml()`, `base64ToBinary()`, and `item()` functions: <br><br>**`xml(base64ToBinary(item()?['Body']))`** |
   | **Advanced parameters** | No | This operation includes the following other parameters: <br><br>- **Preserve Interchange** <br>- **Suspend Interchange on Error** <br><br>For more information, see [X12 message settings](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12-message-settings.md). |

   For example, you can use the **Body** content output from the Request trigger as the XML message payload, but you must first process this content as shown in the following expression:

   `xml(base64ToBinary(item()?['Body']))`
   
   To complete this task, follow these steps:

   1. Select inside **X12 flat file message to decode** box, then select the function icon to open the expression editor.

   1. In the expression editor box, enter the following expression, which references the **Body** output from the Request trigger:

      `xml(base64ToBinary(string(triggerBody())))`

   1. When you're done, select **Add**.
