For AI integration solutions that handle complex scenarios or sophisticated tasks, which often exceed a single agent's capabilities, Azure Logic Apps natively supports common and proven multiagent orchestration patterns that range from simple, composed workflows to complex autonomous systems. Multiple agents help distribute the roles, responsibilities, and workloads in a complex workflow that must perform sophisticated tasks.

Sometimes, your AI integration solution needs to handle a complex scenario or sophisticated tasks that might exceed a single agent's capability, performance, or efficiency. In these scenarios, consider adding and using multiple agents to distribute the roles, responsibilities, and workload in your workflow. Azure Logic Apps natively supports common and proven multiagent orchestration patterns that range from simple, composed workflows to complex autonomous systems.

To help you build more effective multiagent systems, this guide helps you learn and understand the following concepts:

- How multiagent workflows compare to single agent workflows, such as single agent limitations and multiagent benefits.
- Supported multiagent orchestration patterns, which are listed from the simplest to the most complex.
- Considerations to make when choosing the best pattern for your scenario.
- When and how to apply each pattern.

## Single agent limitations versus multiagent benefits

The following table lists the challenges when a single agent performs all the work in a complex solution from interpretation, processing, and reasoning to decision-making and execution.

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Cognitive load | Complex tasks require the agent to juggle multiple concerns at the same time, which leads to decreased performance in individual aspects. |
| Error propagation | One error can derail the entire process with no recovery mechanism. |
| No specialization | You can't optimize one agent equally well for all types of tasks. |
| Scalability constraints | When you add capabilities to a monolithic agent, complexity increases exponentially. |

Multiagent architectures address single-agent limitations by decomposing complex problems into specialized, manageable components. When you design and build your solution using simple, composable patterns, your implementation experiences greater success compared to using complex frameworks. This principle of simplicity and composability exists at the core of multiagent design.

Multiple agents can take on specialized roles, responsibilities, and distribute the workload in a workflow. The following table lists the key multiagent benefits around reliability, maintainability, specialization, and scalability:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Separate concerns | Each agent can focus on a specific expertise area. |
| Independent optimization | You can tune each agent for a specific task. |
| Isolate faults | Errors in one agent don't necessarily cascade to other agents. |
| Reusability | You can reuse specialized agents across different workflows. |
| Human in the loop | You have natural checkpoints for human review and intervention. |
| Scalable development | Teams can separately and independently work on different agents. |

Azure Logic Apps helps you build multiagent systems by providing the following capabilities:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Visual design | Provides a clear graphical representation that shows agent interactions and decision points. |
| Built-in state management | Includes native support for maintaining context across agent calls. |
| Error handling | Offers robust error handling and retry mechanisms. |
| Monitoring and observability | Provides comprehensive logging and monitoring for multiagent workflows. |
| Integration capabilities | Easily integrates with external real-world services and services by letting you create agent tools backed by actions from [1,400+ connectors](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors) in Azure Logic Apps. |
| Scalability | Automatically scales with enterprise-grade reliability. |

## Prompt chaining pattern

This workflow pattern breaks a task into sequential steps. Each step corresponds to a specific agent call. Each large language model (LLM) call processes the output from the previous LLM. In Azure Logic Apps, this pattern translates to a chain of multiple agents where each agent's output becomes the input for the next agent.

- Low complexity level

- Use when the workflow meets the following criteria:

  - Complex tasks require sequential processing.
  - You can cleanly decompose tasks into fixed subtasks that follow a linear sequence.
  - You need validation checks between steps.
  - Each step benefits from specific, focused attention.
  - Quality is more important than speed.

- Examples

  - Generate marketing copy **→** Translate to different language
  - Create document outline **→** Validate outline **→** Write the full document
  - Extract data **→** Validate data **→** Format data

- Key attributes and benefits

  - Predetermined steps follow a linear progression.
  - Each agent focuses on a single, well-defined task, which promotes greater accuracy.
  - Each step can include programmatic checkpoints or validation "gates" for quality control.
  - Easier to debug and identify where problems happen in the chain.
  - Modularity lets you optimize each step independently.
  - Trade off latency for better accuracy and results.

- [Lab: Implement the prompt chaining patterns](https://azure.github.io/logicapps-labs/docs/logicapps-ai-course/build_multi_agent_systems/prompt-chaining)

## Routing pattern

This workflow pattern classifies and directs input to a specialized subsequent task. This behavior lets you separate concerns and allows for specialized prompts that you can optimize for specific input types.

- Low to medium complexity level

- Use when you have distinct input categories that need different or specialized handling.

- Examples

  - Route customer service queries, for example:

    - Billing **→** Billing agent
    - Technical support **→** Technical support agent

  - Classify content, for example:

    - Urgent **→** Priority workflow
    - Routine **→** Routine workflow

  - Select an LLM, for example:

    - Basic questions **→** Basic agent
    - Advanced or complex questions **→** Advanced agent

- Key attributes

  - Initial classification step determines where to route.
  - Different categories get specialized agents.
  - Prevent optimization conflicts between different input types.
  - You can use traditional classification algorithms or LLM-based routing.

For more information, see [Lab: Implement the routing pattern](https://azure.github.io/logicapps-labs/docs/logicapps-ai-course/build_multi_agent_systems/routing-pattern).

## Handoff pattern

This workflow pattern creates seamless transitions between agents while preserving the context and state. This behavior is effective for scenarios that require human-like escalation or expertise transfer.

- Medium complexity level 

- Use when you need to transfer control between agents with different specializations while maintaining the conversation continuity.

- Examples

  - Customer service scenarios, for example, General support **→** Technical specialist **→** Billing
  - Content creation workflows, for example, Research **→** Write **→** Edit
  - Complex problem-solving, for example, Analyze **→** Design solution **→** Implement solution

- Key attributes and benefits

  - Each agent focuses on domain-specific expertise.
  - Handoffs have clear criteria and triggers.
  - Transfer mechanisms have proper context.
  - Agents choose when and where to hand off tasks based on conversation flow.
  - Preserves states or complete conversation history across agent handoffs.
  - Mimics human customer service escalation patterns.
  - Isolates errors or problems in one agent from other agents.
  - Initialization actions exist to prepare the recipient agent.

For more information, see [Lab: Implement the handoff pattern](https://azure.github.io/logicapps-labs/docs/logicapps-ai-course/build_multi_agent_systems/handoff-pattern).

## Parallelization pattern

This workflow pattern has the following primary variations:

- Sectioning: Breaks tasks into independent parallel subtasks.
- Voting: Runs the same task multiple times for diverse outputs.

- Medium complexity level

- Use when subtasks can be processed independently for speed, or when multiple perspectives improve confidence.

- Examples

  - Sectioning

    - Moderate content, for example, one agent checks the content, while another screens for policy violations.
    - Review code, for example, different agents check for security, performance, style, and so on.

  - Voting

    - Multiple agents evaluate content appropriateness using different thresholds.
    - Assess vulnerabilities with consensus-based decision making.

- Key characteristics

  - Improved speed with simultaneous execution.
  - Programmatically aggregated results.
  - Better performance resulting from focused attention on specific aspects.

For more information, see [Lab: Implement the parallelization pattern](https://azure.github.io/logicapps-labs/docs/logicapps-ai-course/build_multi_agent_systems/parallelization-pattern).

## Orchestrator-workers pattern - Nested agents as tools

This workflow pattern treats agents as sophisticated tools that other agents can call. One LLM dynamically breaks down the tasks, delegates the work to other LLMs, and synthesizes their results.

- High complexity level

- Use when you can't predict the required subtasks in advance and need dynamic task decomposition.

- Examples

  - Coding tasks that require changes to unpredictable numbers of files.
  - Research tasks that gather information from multiple dynamic sources.
  - Complex analysis tasks that require different specialized capabilities.

- Key differences from parallelization

  - Orchestrator dynamically determines the necessary subtasks.
  - More flexible but also more unpredictable.
  - Requires sophisticated coordination logic.

For more information, see [Lab: Implement the orchestrator-workers pattern](https://azure.github.io/logicapps-labs/docs/logicapps-ai-course/build_multi_agent_systems/orchestrator-workers).

## Evaluator-optimizer pattern

This workflow pattern has one LLM call generate a response, while another LLM call provides the evaluation and feedback in a loop, which mimics human iterative improvement processes.

- High complexity level

- Use when clear evaluation criteria exist and when iterative refinement provides measurable value.

- Examples

  - Translate literary content with nuanced evaluation and refinement.
  - Perform complex search tasks that require multiple rounds for analysis.
  - Create content, assess quality, and make improvements over multiple iterations.

- Key attributes

  - Runs iterative refinement loops.
  - Requires clear evaluation criteria.
  - Uses generator and evaluator agent roles.
  - Prevents infinite loops by using termination conditions.

For more information, see [Lab: Implement the evaluator-optimizer pattern](https://azure.github.io/logicapps-labs/docs/logicapps-ai-course/build_multi_agent_systems/evaluator-optimizer).
